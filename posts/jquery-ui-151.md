Soon after the release of jQuery UI 1.5, we were getting many useful
feedback and issues entered in our bugtracker. Today, we're happy to
release another version of jQuery UI which takes care of many minor
regressions and a lot of unsolved issues. 1.5.1 doesn't add any new
features or API changes, but fixes more than 50 found issues. A [full
changelog](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Changelog/1.5.1) is available, if
you want to know the specifics. Updating to this version is highly
recommended and likely not to break anything in your written code.
Additionally, issues within ThemeRoller and the demos on our homepage
also have been reported and fixed. We are now continuing to finish all
unit tests and functional demos, so expect to see another release of
both UI and its website soon again. You can grab the latest release as
always via the downloader or as developer package at
[http://ui.jquery.com/download](http://ui.jquery.com/download) or if you
prefer, get it as latest tag from Subversion. See you soon, Paul Bakaus
& the jQuery UI Team
