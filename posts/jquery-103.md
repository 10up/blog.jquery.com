Another bug-fix release is ready for all to enjoy! It is **highly
recommended** that you upgrade right away. As always, if you spot a bug,
please [add it to the bug tracker](http://jquery.com/dev/bugs/new/). As
with the last release, jQuery 1.0.3 is featuring only bug fixes -
leaving all API additions/changes/deletions until the next full release:
jQuery 1.1. Once again, [**JÃ¶rn Zaefferer**](http://bassistance.de/)
did an incredible job really keeping on top of the bugs, fixing the vast
majority of them. Much of this release was made possible by him.

### Download Now:

This release includes a new package: A complete zip file of everything
associated with this release. This includes three versions of jQuery
(Regular, Lite, and Packed), the test suite, and all the documentation.
Now you don't have to build it yourself just to have your own copy.

-   [jQuery 1.0.3](http://jquery.com/src/jquery-1.0.3.js)

    Compressed](http://jquery.com/src/jquery-1.0.3.pack.js)

    Release](http://jquery.com/src/jquery-1.0.3.release.zip) (All
    versions of jQuery 1.0.3, the documentation, and the test suite)

### Tickets Closed:

The full set of bugs, or enhancements, that were closed with this
release: **Note:** Even though about 60 bugs are shown below, many of
them were messed with by spammers - so I'm not entirely sure which ones
were fixed this release and which ones are just zombie bugs that got
re-closed. I'm fairly positive that while there were a lot of bug fixes
this release, there weren't 60 of them.
