![](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jQueryTraining.jpg "jQuery Training")What
started, with great demand, at the San Francisco Bay Area conference
last year and has continued on for the conferences thereafter is our
preconference training.  We are once again offering preconference
training on April 15th for the [jQuery Conference 2011: San Francisco
Bay Area](http://events.jquery.org) but for the first time offering two
separate classes, beginner and advanced. \
\

Introduction to jQuery given by Bocoup
--------------------------------------

\

![Bocoup](http://static.jquery.com/events/2011/sf-bay-area/assets/images/logos/bocoup-horizontal-200.png)Bocoup
gave a bunch of advanced and hack day training classes in Boston last
year in addition to the preconference Introduction to jQuery class,
which also was greatly attended.  We are very happy to announce that
Bocoup will once again be giving the Introduction to jQuery class. From
[Bocoup.com](http://weblog.bocoup.com/training-jquery-san-francisco/comment-page-1):

> The training will be given by Ben Alman (the jQuery plugin guy) and
> Adam Sontag (the yayQuery guy), and has been designed to give
> attendees a basic understanding of the jQuery API, development
> techniques, and best practices. In addition, attendees will learn
> about both jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile, and will be given an
> introduction to extending jQuery with custom plugins.

As usual there is a limited number of tickets for this training class
and they are selling fast.  You’ll need to hurry if you want a seat for
this class. [Tickets for Beginner training are \$299 (plus Eventbright
fees)](http://events.jquery.org/2011/sf-bay-area/register/#training) and
all proceeds go directly to the jQuery Project. Please make sure to
thank [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/) for their support. \
