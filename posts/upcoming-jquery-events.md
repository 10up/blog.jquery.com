![](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/jqm33.jpg) It's
that time of the year again (no, not Christmas!, something almost
better!) - the annual (online) [jQuery Summit](http://jquerysummit.com).
This year [Environment For Humans
(E4H)](http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/) have a terrific line-up
including sessions on jQuery plugin authoring best practices, creating
interactive experiences with HTML5 and Popcorn.js and best practices for
testing your jQuery code amongst others. With some of the web's most
experienced jQuery and JavaScript professionals on board to share tips,
tricks and their own experiences, you'll be sure to learn something new
that could help with your own projects. If you haven't attended the
summit before, you're in for a real treat. The summit is a completely
online two-track conference run across two days with a track dedicated
to designers and another focused completely on developers. As the event
is all online, you can access it live whether you're at home or in the
