explanation of [open space
technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) then the
group will self organize into smaller sessions run in an open space
style until 6pm. There will be plenty of pizza, refreshments and
networking space to meet like minded developers, so come and meet, eat,
