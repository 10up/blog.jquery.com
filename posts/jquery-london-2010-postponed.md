After much deliberation, The jQuery Project Operations Team has decided
to postpone our planned London event this year.  Unfortunately, we were
unable to secure a suitable venue that would allow us to provide the
type of professional-quality event the community has come to expect
within a budget sustainable by the project.  We regret any inconvenience
this may have caused and are actively working on planning a European
event for 2011.
