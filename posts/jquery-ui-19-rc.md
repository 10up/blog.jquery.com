The first release candidate for jQuery UI 1.9 is out! Since the beta
release, we've upgraded to jQuery Core 1.8.0 and jQuery Color 2.0.0 and
landed quite a few more bug fixes. We're getting close to a final
release, but we're still pretty busy working on our new infrastructure.
We're working on a new web site, new download builder, and new
documentation site to accompany the new release. For a list of the major
changes between 1.8 and 1.9, check out the [beta release
announcement](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/06/jquery-ui-1-9-beta/).
Keep in mind that 1.9 brings a lot of API changes, but we're committed
to having 1.9 fully support the 1.8 APIs even though many of them are
deprecated. You can read more about the API redesigns in [a previous
blog
post](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/api-redesigns-the-past-present-and-future/ "API Redesigns: The Past, Present and Future").
For a full list of changes, see the [list of 1.9.0 fixed
tickets](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?resolution=fixed&milestone=1.9.0&group=component).
We're working on a full changelog and upgrade guide for the final
release.
