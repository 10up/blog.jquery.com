Just today [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) pushed a new redesign
live. Amongst other changes, it now uses jQuery as its primary
Javascript code base. This is huge news as another big web site chooses
jQuery as their Javascript library of choice. If I had to guess, as to
why they chose it, I'd say that they appreciated the bandwidth savings
that jQuery afforded them, while still providing a number of useful
usability improvements. I'll see if I can hunt down who was in charge of
the Javascript for the redesign to get their actual thoughts.
