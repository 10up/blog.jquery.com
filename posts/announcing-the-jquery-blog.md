I'd like to take this opportunity to announce the jQuery blog. With
jQuery having been announced just over a week ago, the response has been
enormous. Making it to both [del.icio.us
popular](http://del.icio.us/popuar) and the [front page of
digg](http://digg.com) just shows how badly Javascript programmers want
a better library for writing code with. I'm going to be using this blog
to detail the changes that've been made to the code, announcing new
features, and giving plenty of real-world example. I already have a lot
lined up - and I'm looking forward to pushing this forward! As always,
if you have any questions concerning jQuery, please feel free to [email
me](mailto:jeresig@gmail.com).
