If there are any jQuery users here in Boston, MA - I'm going to be
giving a presentation about jQuery on the 23rd for the local Drupal
group. I'm not sure if it'll be recorded and/or transcribed - but I'll
be sure to throw any slides or examples online after its done. More info
about the event can be found on the [Drupal
website](http://drupal.org/node/79481). Also, I'd love to be able to do
a jQuery meetup sometime, maybe in association with a big conference
(OSCON, AJAX Experience?) But that's for another post.
