With much of the East Coast bracing for the impact of Hurricane Sandy,
now's certainly a good time to take a look back on some sunnier times.
Two weeks ago today, the jQuery Foundation held the first-ever [jQuery
Developer
Summit](http://events.jquery.org/2012/developer-summit/ "2012 jQuery Developer Summit")
at the Aol Campus in Dulles, Va. After a brief morning overview of our
major tools and processes, over 120 team and community members set to
work on nearly every aspect of our projects. We divided into 18 teams
and focused on everything from triaging and fixing bugs and
documentation for jQuery Core, UI, and Mobile, to working on design,
implementation and deployment of our entire network of sites, to
improving our automated testing and gathering and analysis of metrics on
how people use our libraries and websites. In addition to closing (and
opening) hundreds of issues and tickets, and making hundreds of commits
to repositories across our entire organization, it seemed that everyone
in attendance, from grizzled old hands to greenhorn contributors,
learned a lot. We were happy to celebrate a lot of firsts, whether it
was somebody's first commit on a jQuery repository, or their first git
commit, period. Of course, not everything went off without a hitch, and
we've been gathering feedback and figuring out how we can do even better
next time. What that means, of course, is that there will be a next
time!  With such an incredible energy in the room for the two days, and
a new group of contributors digging in on all of our projects, we're
certainly looking forward to another go-round. Watch this space and

And finally, we'd like to extend a hearty thanks to each and every one
of you who joined us for two days to help out and participate, we could
not have done it without you! Thank you!
