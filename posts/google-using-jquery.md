Google relaunched their [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) site with
a new design and, you guessed it, jQuery under the hood! Dion Almaer,
employee at Google and co-founder of
[Ajaxian.com](http://www.ajaxian.com), [discusses the redesign on his
blog](http://almaer.com/blog/google-code-relaunches-new-redesign-using-jquery-great-video-content-and-more)
and makes mention to the fact that the Google team is now using jQuery
for the Google Code site. [DeWitt Clinton also discusses this on the
Google Code
Blog](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/11/my-how-weve-grown.html):

> For example, the search results pages use a combination of the AJAX
> Search API and Custom Search Engines. The homepage gadgets use the
> AJAX Feed API and Google Reader feeds. The videos are powered by the
> YouTube API, the blogs by the Blogger API, the events powered by the
> Google Calendar API, the metrics by Google Analytics, the forums by
> Google Groups, etc., etc.. ***And we're pleased to use jQuery, the
> wonderful open source JavaScript library (not ours, we're just fans),
> to help power each page.*** Stay tuned -- over the upcoming weeks
> we'll offer detailed articles and tutorials about how we built the
> various parts of Google Code using open technologies.

As pioneers in the Ajax and JavaScript space, it's extremely exciting to
have Google use jQuery to help them build out this site and we look
forward to helping the Google team in the future.
