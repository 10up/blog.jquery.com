I wanted to give everyone an update as to the progress that's been made
(and being made) on jQuery right now. A bunch of us have been working
very hard on getting jQuery squared away for a proper 1.0 release. In
order to achieve this goal, I wanted a couple things done:

1.  Cutting down the size. I want jQuery no larger than 15k - as of
    right now, the code in SVN is sitting at a nice 14.8k (or so).
2.  Speed ups. Some very important speed ups are going into place,
    including caching and object-oriented code.
3.  Stability. I want jQuery 1.0 to be a solid release that will be
    supported for a very long time.
4.  Excellent documentation. We've been working on getting the new
    jQuery Wiki squared away. It's release, along with brand new
    documentation, will be released at the same time as the 1.0 release.

The game plan is to have a copy of 1.0 out by the end of the month
(probably a beta). Right now, the biggest thing left is to write are
lots and lots of test cases to make sure that everything is running
smoothly. If you'd like to help with test cases, or with the
documentation efforts, please comment on this post or post in the
mailing list. This is going to be a great release - I'm really excited
about the quality of code that's coming out of it, and I'm sure you will
be too.
