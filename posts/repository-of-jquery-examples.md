Mark Constable has created an excellent, and well-documented, resource
for some interesting advanced [jQuery
Examples](http://markc.renta.net/jquery/). The examples range from the
simple (such as fading text in and out) to the complex (such as live
searching or input field focusing). All of the examples are fully
documented, which makes this a great place to learn some new techniques
from. Also, Mark provides a simple format for submitting new examples,
so I imagine that this repository will only grow in size (it's already
up to 10 entries). So check it out and be sure to thank Mark for all his
hard work!
