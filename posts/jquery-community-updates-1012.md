This is a big week for jQuery with our [second release
candidate](http://blog.jquery.com/2010/10/12/jquery-1-4-3-release-candidate-2-released/)
for jQuery 1.4.3 already out and available for testing. We would like to
thank everyone that's been submitting their feedback and bug reports on
it as they have been very helpful in making this release as stable as
possible. Remember that if you've got a bug you would like to report,
you can easily submit one through our [bug
tracker](http://bugs.jquery.com). **Our New Bug Tracker** Regarding the
bug tracker, I would like to hand you over to Colin Snover who has an
announcement to make about our bug tracking system:

> Today we’ve introduced a new bug tracking system for jQuery core. In
> addition to being a lot faster and easier to use, the new Trac has a
> bunch of great new features that we hope you enjoy. We’ve tried hard
> to make sure that both end-users and developers are given a much
> better experience than what they were used to from the old service.
> The most important change is the addition of voting, which will help
> the team prioritize which bugs and new features are of greatest
> concern to the members of the jQuery community. Up until now, there
> was no way to get such a concrete metric of which issues people felt
> were most important, so we’re very excited about this feature and hope
> you will use it to help us get an idea of what you want to see most in
> the library. We added a login-free bug reporting mode, which will
> allow anyone to report a bug without needing to go through a
> registration process first. We also significantly improved the
> reporting process, so that when submitting a ticket, only a summary,
> description, version number, and issue type need to be provided.
> Another great new feature of the new Trac is a more customisable
> notifications system, which allows anyone to pick and choose exactly
> when they receive emails about ticket changes. This feature also
> introduces the ability to “watch” tickets, so you can be kept
> up-to-date about tickets that you care about without needing to visit
> the bug tracker on a regular basis. For jQuery developers, the new bug
> tracker offers a glut of improvements. Most visibly, we are now able
> to set up cross-references, so we know which issues block and are
> blocked by other tickets. We’ve also integrated support for GitHub, so
> changes to the jQuery GitHub repository are reflected automatically in
> Trac on the timeline and in the ticket system. Finally, changes have
> been made to the ticket workflow such that duplicate tickets can be
> addressed much more quickly, and tickets that are abandoned by their
> submitters are automatically closed to keep the number of invalid
> reports low. We’re really excited about everything that has been added
> to the new bug tracker and we hope you will take a look today!

*We encourage users to login when submitting a new bug report as this
will allow you to see and use some of the new improved features such as
the voting widget and notifications regarding follow-ups on your bug
report. Let us know what you think about it!.* **Community Support** One
of the great things about our community is that we're always ready and
willing to give a hand to those just getting started out with jQuery. In
this spirit, we would like to invite members with experience using it to
get involved with the [jQuery Forums](http://forum.jquery.com/)- this is
a great place for assisting beginners with questions they may have about
jQuery or just helping out members that are having some trouble getting
their code to correctly function. To get started all you need to do is
create a new forum account or alternatively sign in using your Google,
Yahoo or Facebook account. **A Call For New jQuery And jQuery UI
Tutorials** The [jQuery](http://docs.jquery.com/) & [jQuery
UI](http://jqueryui.com/demos/) documentation sites are an excellent
source of information on how to get started with jQuery, but we also
like to provide the community with links to tutorials which might go
into greater depth about particular topics. If you enjoy writing about
jQuery or jQuery UI, we would like to invite you to write an up-to-date
tutorial on a particular aspect, function or component that we can then
share with the rest of the community. The best tutorials may get added
to our officially recommended tutorials page
[here](http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials). Please feel free to get in
touch if you would like to submit a tutorial for review. **jQuery
Conferences** The [Official jQuery
Conference](http://events.jquery.org/2010/boston/) in Boston is going to
be held on the 16th of this month and all jQuery team members attending
are looking forward to seeing you there if you're going. If you can't
make it however, don't worry! No matter where you're based, you can
still register for the [jQuery Online
Summit](http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/2010/jquery-summit/)
running between November 16th-17th featuring speakers such as John
Resig, Paul Irish, Rey Bango and many more. Thanks and stay tuned for
more updates from the jQuery team!
