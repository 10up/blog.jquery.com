[![Fisheye Dock
Menu](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/css-dock-menu.jpg)](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/blog/mac/css-dock-menu)
With a little bit of nice theming, the
[Fisheye](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/fisheye.html) component from
[Interface](http://interface.eyecon.ro/) has been adapted to build a
beautiful "**[CSS dock
menu](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/demo/css-dock-menu/css-dock.html)**".
It's currently making all the rounds on design blogs and on
[Digg](http://digg.com/design/Amazing_CSS_Dock_Menu). Some more
information about what this menu was designed for can be found on the
[developer's
site](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/blog/mac/css-dock-menu):

> If you are a big Mac fan, you will love this [CSS dock
> menu](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/demo/css-dock-menu/css-dock.html)
> that I designed. It is using [jQuery JavaScript
> library](http://jquery.com/) and
> [Fisheye](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/fisheye.html) component
> from [Interface](http://interface.eyecon.ro/) and some of my
> [icons](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/stock-icons/). It comes with two
> dock styles - top and bottom. This CSS dock menu is perfect to add on
> to my Wordpress
> [iTheme](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/resources/wp-themes/itheme/).
> Here I will show you how to implement it to your web page.
