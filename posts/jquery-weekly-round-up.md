[Mark Panay](http://www.markpanay.com/) has written [a follow
up](http://www.markpanay.com/2006/03/jquery-for-web-designers-part-2.html)
to [JQuery for Web
Designers](http://www.markpanay.com/2006/02/jquery-for-web-designers-part-1.html).
This time he emphasizes keeping content brief and using jQuery to reveal
the full body of blog posts and articles. This is very similar to a
technique that I have been using in my latest project,
[Ouioo](http://ouioo.com). Also, Mark has launched a new [music
start-up](http://tunecast.co.uk/) whose web site makes use of jQuery fx
and AJAX. To quote Mark:

> [jQuery] replaces, the "behaviour, prototype and AHAH" scripts there
> before, thus saving me about 150k... :) and making the code cleaner
> and easier to modify. Only took 30 mins as well.

Finally, [Frank Quednau](http://www.realfiction.net/acute/) has released
a blog post and a [jQuery querying
demo](http://www.realfiction.net/acute/2006/03/10/querying-jquery-take-1/).
If you're curious as to what exactly jQuery is capable of querying -
this makes for a good sandbox to go in and play around with things.
