1.  Name (anonymous if you must)
2.  Are you using jQuery corporately or for your personal use?
3.  Describe how you are using jQuery.
4.  Showcase! Link to any of your projects that use jQuery.

We would really like to get to know a lot of you better, not just the
hardcore developers but the everyday users. So give us the scoop! (Or,
"let us know a little about you, and shamelessly plug your projects,
too!"). **UPDATE:** Thanks to all who have responded so far. I have to
say, I am astonished at how many of you are using jQuery for corporate
sites. Many of you (or your companies) might consider donating to the
jQuery project from the [homepage](http://jquery.com/). Of course, this
is not required, but it does ensure jQuery stays strong by covering the
costs of development and keeping the monthly server bill in check. :)
And to that I will add: bug reports, plugins, and other contributions to
the community are equally valuable as donations. My point: *Let's
remember to all give back in whatever ways we can.* *All* of your
comments are invaluable, whether you're a big-timer working on corporate
sites or a small-timer building a webapp just for fun. Keep 'em coming!
