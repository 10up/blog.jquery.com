Next weekend is the [San Francisco Bay Area jQuery
Conference](http://events.jquery.org/2010/sf-bay-area/) that will be
held at the Microsoft Silicon Valley Campus Conference Center in
Mountain View, California.  There are still a few tickets remaining and
tickets can be
[purchased](http://events.jquery.org/2010/sf-bay-area/register/) up
until Sunday April 18th. In addition to the [great
talks](http://events.jquery.org/2010/sf-bay-area/schedule/) that will be
given on jQuery core there are quite a few talks about jQuery UI.  Here
are the details on those talks:

jQuery UI Fundamentals

D. Worth** Saturday 4:30p.m., Room 2* Widgets done richly. These tools
work the way jQuery does, helping you build a rich user interface with
ease. jQuery UI, built on top of jQuery, is a complete set of
interactions and widgets for building Rich Internet Applications. A few
examples include drag-and-drop, resizing, mouse-sorting,
mouse-selecting, autocomplete, button, datepicker, dialog, progressbar,
slider, and tabs. Each component adheres to a consistent standard across
API, design, behavior and theming. This minimizes the surprise and makes
learning all of them as easy as learning one. This talk covers how
jQuery UI is designed and how it leverages the power, flexibility, and
expressiveness of the jQuery API. A live demonstration shows you how to
use some of the more common jQuery UI interactions and widgets. As an
intro, this talk will be a great base for later jQuery UI talks that
deal with creating or extending jQuery UI widgets and jQuery UI theming.

jQuery UI Widget Factory
------------------------

J. Sontag** Sunday 11a.m., Room 2* Charlie and the Widget Factory All
the delicious widgets in jQuery UI are have a sweet, creamy center: The
jQuery UI Widget Factory. By encapsulating a useful infrastructure for
creating complex jQuery plugins into a base class, the widget factory
can be your golden ticket to creating complex (or not-that-complex),
reusable components for your web app/site. We'll begin by exploring some
common approaches to developing jQuery plugins, highlighting the
strengths and weaknesses of various patterns, and identifying the shared
characteristics involved in setting up robust, stateful widgets. Then,
I'll reveal the awesome secret that's at the heart of the whole
presentation: The authors of jQuery UI have already done just that, and
their work is your gain. Armed with that tasty morsel, we'll conceive,
gestate, and give birth to a widget in almost no time flat. By the time
our tour concludes, you'll have an understanding of when the widget
factory is an appropriate solution to your problem, its potential
drawbacks, and how to use it to create plugins that are lean, limber,
and logical. If, of course, you are wise and listen to me, like the
Oompa Loompa Doompety Dee.

Inside ThemeRoller 2.0: Refactoring for Speed
---------------------------------------------

Neiner** *Sunday 1:15p.m., Room 1* Doug has been working on the new
version of ThemeRoller for the jQuery UI site. In his talk, Doug aims to
give you a peak of the code and show off some of the speed improvements
that are being made. The new version of ThemeRoller is being built on
top of the latest technologies like Canvas and HTML5. You will see how
you can use client side technologies to reduce server load and maximize
the speed of your app.

Advanced Uses of jQuery UI
--------------------------

González** *Sunday 2:45p.m., Room 1* jQuery UI provides a suite of
plugins that can be used to build Rich Internet Applications. However,
just like jQuery, it can't do everything you need right out of the box.
In this session we'll cover how to extend jQuery UI plugins and how to
build new plugins on top of what jQuery UI provides.

Jumping into the jQuery Community
---------------------------------

Whitbeck** *Sunday 3:30p.m., Room 2* Are you looking to get more
involved with the jQuery project but don't know what you can do to help?
Do you want to make a difference and be recognized for your
contributions to jQuery? Even if you don't have the JavaScript chops to
add dazzling new features to the jQuery core, there are still plenty of
direct ways for you to contribute back to the community. In this talk,
we'll explore various options available to both designers and developers
for contributing back to the jQuery Community. We'll discuss ways to
have a big impact on a great number of people—from offering help on the
forum to sharing plugins to writing tutorials. And we'll look at the
proper procedures for reporting bugs and submitting patches. This talk
is meant for anyone who is interested in jQuery, from the very beginner
to the more advanced user who is looking to get more involved.
