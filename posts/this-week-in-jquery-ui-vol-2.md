Another week in the [The Year of jQuery
UI](http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/01/the-year-of-jquery-ui). Here's
what happened:

### Releases

#### 1.7.1

The first maintenance release for 1.7 came this week: [jQuery UI
1.7.1](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/03/jquery-ui-171/). Here's the
[changelog](http://jqueryui.com/docs/Changelog/1.7.1). We've made some
much-needed updates to the download builder. We're hopeful this will fix
the problems some people were having with certain browser and OS
configurations. If you still have any issues, be sure to file them in
the [bug tracker](http://dev.jqueryui.com/newticket) (note: requires
registration).

#### 1.6rc2.5

The latest legacy preview release has been out just over a week and has
only two issues (so far) filed against it. Things are looking good for
being able to release 1.6 final on March 25th.

### SXSWi

jQuery UI ThemeRoller was a finalist for an SXSWi Web Award this week.
Here's the coverage from Wired:

Congrats and thanks to [Filament Group](http://filamentgroup.com/) and
everyone else on the jQuery UI Team that has contributed to ThemeRoller.

### ThemeRoller-ready Plugins

-   trirand.com: The fabulous jqGrid plugin added support this week for
    [jQuery UI Theming](http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming), making it
    [ThemeRoller-ready](http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/ThemeRollerReady).
    This is not yet in a final release, but can be seen in the [3.5
    alpha](http://www.trirand.com/blog/?p=231). Great job, Tony.

Remember, ThemeRoller and the jQuery UI CSS Framework aren't just for
jQuery UI plugins. So if you have a plugin, what about making it
ThemeRoller-ready? Or if you have a favorite plugin that you'd like to
see ThemeRoller-ready, send a donation (or at the very least a thank you
note) to the plugin maintainer, and encourage them to add support.
