[![jQuery
Widget](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/jquery-widget.gif)](http://blog.medallia.com/2007/05/jquery_dashboard_widget.html)
Ryan Dunphey has just released a brand new [jQuery Dashboard
Widget](http://blog.medallia.com/2007/05/jquery_dashboard_widget.html)
that you can use to browse the jQuery API, even when you're not
connected to the Internet. You can
[download](http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/dashboard-widget/jQuery-dashboard-widget.v1.0.zip)
the, sharply designed, widget from jQuery SVN. If you're interested in
doing some dashboard development (and especially widget development
using jQuery), you can learn from this widget, as the [full source
code](http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/dashboard-widget/jQuery.wdgt/)
of it is in the jQuery SVN repository. This fantastic work (and the
subsequent open source release of the widget) was sponsored by Ryan's
employer, [Medallia](http://medallia.com/). Incidentally, if you're
interested in getting paid to do some jQuery coding, Medallia has a
[Front-End Developer](http://blog.medallia.com/jobs/) position open.
