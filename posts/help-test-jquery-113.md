A test build of the upcoming 1.1.3 release is ready for everyone to try.
We need to be super-sure that there haven't been any regressions in this
release, and in order to do that we'd like you to download this alpha
release and try it in place of jQuery 1.1.2 (wherever you may be using
it). **Download the test release:**

-   [jQuery 1.1.3a (Uncompressed, Test
    Release)](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.1.3a.js)

\
Here's what you can do to help:

1.  Download the [test release of jQuery
    1.1.3](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.1.3a.js)
2.  Temporarily replace your copy of jQuery 1.1.2 with this test release
    in some of your web pages
3.  If something is now broken, please [submit a
    ticket](http://dev.jquery.com/newticket) letting us know what
    happened. The more specific you can be, the better (demos or test
    cases are highly desired).

**Note** Pay special attention to **Events, Selectors, and Animations**;
significant changes happened in all three of those areas, so if there's
any place where a regression is possible, it would be more likely to
occur in there. Once we're confident that there's no new bugs, we'll be
releasing jQuery 1.1.3 fully (hopefully some time this week).
