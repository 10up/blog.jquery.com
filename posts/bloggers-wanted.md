On the road up to 1.0 there is one thing, that we've been lacking in,
that we need more of: Lots of jQuery bloggers! With my commitment to
squishing bugs in the jQuery core, adding new features, writing
documentation - I just don't have time to keep the blog updated with all
the hot new projects that are coming out. So, here is what I'd like: I'd
like to turn the jQuery blog into a group blog, discussing jQuery,
Javascript, jQuery Plugins/Projects/Apps, AJAX - anything that relates
back to jQuery or Javascript. The blog currently has around 800-900
readers - which is decent, considering that I haven't put much time into
it (It's also ranked in the top 6000 on Technorati). I see this as being
a great opportunity for different members of the diverse jQuery audience
to really come together - especially for those who don't feel confident
committing code changes. Here are some of the ideas that I've come up
with, for blogging "positions":

-   jQuery on the Web (find people writing and building with jQuery, and
    talk about it)
-   jQuery on the List (collect and talk about all the projects and news
    that take place on the mailing list)
-   Weekly List Recap (Recap the important events/discussions of the
    mailing list every week)
-   jQuery News (Project Announcements, bug fixes, etc - this will
    probably be done by me)
-   jQuery Hacks (Cool things that you can do with jQuery - compare with
    other libraries)
-   Javascript News (Report on new techniques, libraries, hacks -
    whatever)
-   jQuery International (The jQuery user base is all over the globe -
    having articles/sections in other languages would be fantastic!)

If we can get even half of this up and running, we will definitely
become a top blog for Javascript news - which would be good in so many
ways. If this project interests you, please reply to this post, or email
me personally. I'd also like to see a sample of your code and/or writing
(if I haven't seen it already). If you have any ideas, feel free to
bring them up, I'm all ears!
