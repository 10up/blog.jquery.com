We're excited to announce [the release of jQuery UI
v1.7](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/03/jquery-ui-17/), the newest
version of jQuery's effects and UI library. This release culminates many
months of development in which a major overhaul of the whole library was
performed and a new CSS framework introduced, all in order to provide a
professional and easily extensible set of UI controls and effects for
jQuery developers. The new CSS framework is especially exciting since it
will not only allow for easy theming of jQuery UI controls but also
allow plugin authors in general to take advantage of
[ThemeRoller](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller), the dynamic theme
generation application developed by the Filament Group for the jQuery UI
project. Full details of this new & exciting release can be found on
[the new jQuery UI
blog](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/03/jquery-ui-17/).
