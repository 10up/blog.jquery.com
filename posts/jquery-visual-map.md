Jeffery Chiang recently submitted an excellent visual representation of
the jQuery library, to the jQuery mailing list. It shows all the
different plugins and what methods/features they support (borrowed from
the [jQuery Documentation](http://jquery.com/docs/)). Similar diagrams
have been done for the Prototype library - but none of them have the
cool Devo hat of jQuery to go along with it. If anyone is feeling
adventurous, using the styles of this map would make for an awesome
redesign of the documentation page.
