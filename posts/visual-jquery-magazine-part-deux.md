Those of you who have been around for a while know that in September of
last year I published the first issue of the *[Visual jQuery
Magazine](http://www.visualjquery.com/magazine)*. In October, the
magazine was also released in French. The mag had interviews with
important jQuery community members (like creator John Resig, plugin
editor Dave Cardwell, etc.), articles on jQuery features and
implementations, and even a piece or two on alternate Javascript
libraries, complete with quality graphics and original art. The positive
response was incredible, and people really seemed to like it.
Unfortunately, though I'd initially planned on making the magazine a
monthly publication, things fell to the wayside as my schedule got
progressively more hectic. Since Issue 1 I've found a new job (new then;
about eight or nine months old now), moved across the country (NY to
CA), and gotten a huge chunk of the way through writing my first book
(stay tuned for details!). Clearly, things have been busy. The lack of
Issue 2 has been bugging me since Issue 1, and I've decided it's time to
make it happen (this, I admit, is also largely in part to my good friend
Rey Bango's recently renewed effort to push jQuery forward). Thankfully,
the magazine's lead designer and the team of French
developers/translators have all expressed an interest in helping make
Issue 2 happen, which makes this goal a lot more tangible. Issue 1 was
an experiment, and it went really well. Since it was a first though, it
was very much "the Yehuda show." I'd like Issue 2 to be more of a
collaboration of contributors; there are a lot of jQuery topics to
explore, and a lot of team member and users with fascinating tales to
tell. As such, I'm putting the word out there. I'm looking for
contributions for Issue 2 of *Visual jQuery Magazine*. Articles can vary
in length extensively, from brief three paragraph shorts, to three page
features. They can be tutorials, feature articles, interviews and lots
of other things I'm sure you'll all think of. Just a few brief (and
somewhat flexible) guidelines:
The article must be in magazine or newspaper format (if, in fact, your
submission is a piece of writing -- illustrations will also be
considered). I'm extremely lax on this, but it should be something you
could see being in a magazine.
The article must be about a topic that is timely and pertinent to the
jQuery community, with broad appeal.
The article must not be an advertisement (but it may, obviously, feature
a plugin you have written if it has broad appeal).
The article must be factually correct.
The magazine staff will edit your article for grammar, space, and style.
You will receive an edited copy prior to publication for approval.
The magazine staff will add graphics and other visual elements as
appropriate.
Please email a proposal or brief description of your submission before
spending a chunk of time working on it; that way we can avoid running
out of space and ensure that everything print-worthy gets in. Email
submissions and letters to the editor to editor AT visualjquery DOT com.
As I said from the beginning of this project, I think that the magazine
has real potential to open up the jQuery world to new users, and hope
that by pushing the envelope of community-produced content, we can keep
jQuery moving forward in it's current positive direction. I, for one,
I'm really excited about it. I will also be accepted advertisements,
with all proceeds to go to the jQuery project. If you're interested,
please email me!
