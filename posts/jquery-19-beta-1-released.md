You've been good boys and girls this year, so look what Santa left under
the source tree: jQuery 1.9 Beta 1! We've made a lot of changes this
time, so we need your help in testing more than ever. Please don't leave
us feeling awkward at the holiday party with that punch bowl full of
warm eggnog and the creepy guy from accounting. Just take a few minutes
out of your holiday schedule and try this with your code. It's a gift we
will definitely appreciate. jQuery 1.9 has removed many of the items we
deprecated during the last few versions of jQuery. For that reason,
we're introducing the [jQuery
Migrate](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/) plugin. This plugin
restores several of the deprecated and removed features so that existing
code can run, without changing the code. However, it's intended as a
short-term stopgap and shouldn't be used for new work. To make migration
easier, the development version (linked below) also provides browser
console warnings to let you know which obsolete features the code is
still using. See the [plugin
documentation](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/warnings.md)
for a list of messages you may see. To test, we recommend that you start
with the jQuery Migrate plugin since it will warn you about any
deprecated features the code may depend on. Just include these two
script tags in your code, replacing your existing jQuery script include:
` <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0b1.js"></script> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.0.0b1.js"></script>`
**Be sure to update to the most recent versions of jQuery UI and jQuery
Mobile if you are also using them.** If the browser's console does not
show any "JQMIGRATE" warning messages generated by the jQuery Migrate
plugin, try removing the jquery-migrate include and try jQuery 1.9 in
all its squeaky-clean glory. If you have questions, feedback, or
complaints about the beta that aren't specifically bugs, let us know in
the [jQuery Forum](http://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-core).
Issues regarding the migration plugin not discussed below or in the
[upgrade guide](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9) can be reported at
the [jQuery Migrate Issue
tracker](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues); include a
test case that we can use to diagnose the problem. The best way to do
that is create a simple test at [jsFiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net) or
[jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com). You can this [jsFiddle
tempate](http://jsfiddle.net/4ZwWv/) or [jsbin
template](http://jsbin.com/emuwuy/4/edit) as a starting point; they
already contain links to the work-in-progress versions of both jQuery
and the jQuery Migrate plugin. Add your code there and post a link to it
with your bug report. If you're seeing problems after fixing any
migration issues, removing jQuery Migrate, and using the 1.9 beta by
itself, you can report them at the main [jQuery core bug
tracker](http://bugs.jquery.com/). A test case is *essential* here as
well so that we can analyze the problem. Again, if you have questions,
feedback, or complaints about the beta that aren't specifically bug
reports, use the [jQuery
Forum](http://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-core).

What's New
----------

The majority of work in 1.9 has revolved around API cleanup. Changes
most likely to affect existing code are listed in the [jQuery 1.9
Upgrade Guide](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9), and these changes
will also carry over to 2.0. The jQuery Migrate plugin will identify
many of these issues for you automatically, so it's good to use the
plugin in your initial testing to see if it identifies anything that
needs to be changed. We couldn't let a version like this escape without
adding at least one new feature; it's a good one.
`$(element).css([ name1, name2 … ])`: This is a new getter that
retrieves multiple CSS properties for the first element in a collection
and returns them as an object with properties. In addition to the
shorter code, this signature provides up to 25 percent better
performance because it can use the same return value from the browser's
\`.getComputedStyle()\` method rather calling the method for each css
property. Typical use might be like this:

    var dims = $("#box").css([ "width", "height", "backgroundColor" ]);
    //  { width: "10px", height: "20px", backgroundColor: "#D00DAD" }

Finally, no major version would be complete without fixes for a variety
of bugs and peculiar edge cases that you've discovered and reported on
the bug tracker. Those, along with all the other modifications, are all
cataloged in the changelog below.

How It's Made
-------------

Possibly the most exciting news of this beta is that so many
contributors -- new and veteran -- worked to make jQuery better. Our
first [jQuery Developer
Summit](http://blog.jquery.com/2012/10/29/jquery-developer-summit-recap/)
in October brought in some incredibly skilled developers that we hope
will continue to stay with us, and several new contributors dared to
tackle bugs that have been open for more than a year! If you're
interested, [you can help out
too](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Let's give a round of applause to the people who contributed their code
gifts to this 1.9 beta: Akintayo Akinwunmi, Alexander Farkas, Allen J
Schmidt Jr, Ben Truyman, Bennett Sorbo, Callum Macrae, Carl Danley,
Corey Frang, Daniel Gálvez, Dan Morgan, David Bonner, David Fox, Devin
Cooper, Elijah Manor, Erick Ruiz de Chavez, Greg Lavallee, Ismail Khair,
James Huston, Jay Merrifield, Jonathan Sampson, Julian Aubourg, Marcel
Greter, Matt Farmer, Matthias Jäggli, Mike Petrovich, Mike Sherov, Oleg
Gaidarenko, Paul Ramos, Richard Gibson, Rick Waldron, Rod Vagg, Roland
Eckl, Sai Wong, Scott González, Timmy Willison, Timo Tijhof, Tom
Fuertes, and Yi Ming He. If you happen to see them under the mistletoe
... well, you know what to do.
