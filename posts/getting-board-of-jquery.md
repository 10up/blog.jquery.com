**TL;DR The body responsible for overseeing jQuery's finances and
administration, which was until today known as the jQuery Team, is now
called the jQuery Board. The jQuery Team is for anyone who invests a
significant amount of time contributing to jQuery and its related
projects.** As jQuery has grown from a [cool idea in
2005](http://ejohn.org/blog/selectors-in-javascript/ "Selectors In Javascript")
to [the most widely used piece of JavaScript on the Internet
today](http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/top), so too has the
organizational structure required to support its development and its
community. Over time, e-mail chains became mailing lists, and out of
those lists evolved a casual confederation known as the jQuery Team. To
join this team, all you had to do was make a consistent contribution to
some aspect of the project and eventually John would add your name to a
page in our docs wiki. By 2009, the team wanted to solidify the
long-term future of the project, so we accepted an invitation to [join
the Software Freedom
Conservancy](http://blog.jquery.com/2009/12/03/jquery-joins-the-software-freedom-conservancy/),
from whom we’ve since received great amounts of administrative and legal
support. Though the SFC offers that “Projects can continue to operate in
the same way they did before joining the Conservancy without having to
select a board of directors or any other layer of corporate management,”
the team chose to implement a governance system whereby the project’s
official decisions would be communicated to the Conservancy after a
[public vote](https://groups.google.com/group/jquery-board-public) by
the members of the “core team,” which initially had 21 members. This
conferred a significant amount of formality onto what had been a
relatively ad hoc process, and while the system has worked well, it has
been accompanied by some confusion.

-   On one hand, there’s the voting membership, responsible primarily
    for financial and managerial decisions concerning the entire
    project. On the other, there’s an actual group of people who are
    working on jQuery Core itself. Both of these groups are sometimes
    called the jQuery Core Team, which is fairly misleading.
-   As new people come along and become active contributors to some part
    of the project, it’s not fun to tell them, “Hey, great job, but
    you’re \*not\* on the team!”
-   Just because you are really interested in hacking on jQuery Core,
    UI, or Mobile (or working on docs, or any of the many other ways you
    can help out the project) doesn’t mean you have the slightest desire
    to sit in long meetings, discussing how to allocate funds and how to
    improve beverage service at the next conference.
-   As people’s lives ebb and flow, it’s normal that their capacity to
    contribute changes. What’s the right correlation between being a
    genuinely active contributor in the present tense and having a vote
    in the project’s big-picture management?

In order to attempt to resolve some of this confusion and make clearer
the group’s purpose, **the jQuery Team is now known as the jQuery
Board**, and all the governance rules that applied to the Team now apply
to the Board. The Board is responsible for

-   approving and appropriating expenditures
-   representing the intentions of the jQuery Project to the SFC
-   overseeing and directing the Subteams and selecting the Subteam
    Leads responsible for each of the facets of the project
-   voting on its own composition

If you’ve always wanted to be “on the team,” but were unsure of what it
meant or what you would do, this is good news! We’re fully embracing
[the Wikipedia definition of team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team): a
group of people (or animals!) linked in a common purpose. As
such,**anyone who volunteers, over a sustained period of time, to serve
actively on a jQuery Subteam will be invited to join the jQuery
Team**(at the discretion of the Subteam Lead), so you can feel good
putting that on your slide decks, refrigerators, and so forth. What
isn’t changing is the fact that if you are passionate about web
development and trying to find a way to make a difference to developers
around the world, there is a place for you in the jQuery community. Hop
onto [the forum](http://forum.jquery.com/) and give another developer a
hand. Head over to our
[various](http://bugs.jquery.com "jQuery Bug Tracker")
[bug](http://bugs.jqueryui.com "jQuery UI Bug Tracker")
[trackers](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues "jQuery Mobile Issues on Github")
and help triage the open issues — or [dive in and see if you can provide
a
patch](http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide "jQuery Bug Fixing Guide").
If you just want to get a lay of the land, join the [weekly IRC
meetings](http://jquery.org/meeting). Want to work on a particular
project? Take a look through the [updated team
page](http://jquery.org/team) and get in touch with the right subteam
lead! One thing’s for sure: [![jQuery wants
you!](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/jquery_iwantyou-269x300.jpg "jQuery wants you!")](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/jquery_iwantyou.jpg)
