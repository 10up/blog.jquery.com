A lot has happened this week in jQueryland. Here are a few highlights:

### jQuery Core Development

Brandon Aaron has been on a roll the past few days, fixing bugs and
enhancing features for the next version of jQuery. Among the updates
committed to the Subversion repository were better support for nested
fixed position elements and added support for contexts other than
document with the .live() and .die() event delegation methods. See the
[past week's timeline
here](http://dev.jquery.com/timeline?from=03%2F21%2F09&daysback=7&changeset=on&update=Update).

### Plugins
