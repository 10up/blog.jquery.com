We still have 7 more days of jQuery 1.4 to come with more video's and
more releases to announce. Again, events like these are not possible
without support from our [great sponsors](http://jquery14.com/sponsors)
and from you, the jQuery Community. We'd like to thank everyone who has
donated so far, and we'd like to remind everyone that you will receive a
free ebook with the [donation of \$20 or more throughout the 14 Days of
jQuery](http://jquery14.com/donate). **Media Template Giveaway** Each
day during the 14 days of jQuery, a web developer will receive a free

hosting provider, [Media Temple](http://www.mediatemple.com). A grand

team member Cody Lindley has published the [jQuery
Enlightenment](http://www.jqueryenlightenment.com) book, and if you
haven't checked it out yet, you'll definitely want to. "Each chapter
contains concepts essential to becoming a seasoned jQuery developer,"'"
so even if you've already got *your* copy, pick one up for a friend
who's just learning! Even better, a percentage of all sales goes
directly back to the jQuery project and helps fund future releases and
projects. A big thank you to Cody for his generous donation for the 14
Days of jQuery campaign!
