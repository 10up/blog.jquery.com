[Joe Hewitt](http://www.joehewitt.com/) is working on updating his
excellent [Firebug](http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/) Firefox
extension. If you're not familiar with it, you should be. It provides
detailed per-page error tracking, XMLHTTPRequest tracking, DOM
Navigation - everything that a Javascript developer needs. The new
version of Firebug is adding one more feature: [Javascript
debugging](http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/goodbye_venkman.php). This will
allow you to set break points in your code, pause the application,
restart it, and all sorts of cool stuff. If this sounds interesting to
you, you should contact Joe, as he needs testers to help him get this
off the ground.
