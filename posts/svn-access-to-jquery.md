I've slowly been moving jQuery over to SVN during the past month, with
the move being nearly complete now. So, if you wish to keep track of
jQuery through Subversion (and make sure you always have the latest
code), you can do so via:

-   [The jQuery SVN Web Interface](http://jquery.com/dev/svn/) (This
    will probably soon change to a Trac-based installation.)
-   Or checking the code out manually using:
    `svn co svn://jquery.com/jquery`

The biggest changes left to come to the repository is the creation of
branches to keep track of the different versions of code, along with
some solid, reliable, versioning for the main code base. I'll have more
specific news about that update, soon. If you have any questions
concerning the code in the repository, or if you'd like to be able to
commit, be sure to drop the [the mailing
list](http://jquery.com/discuss/).
