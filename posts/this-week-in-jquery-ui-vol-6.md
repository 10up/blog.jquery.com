### Releases

The 1.6 release was finalized last night, and is available for download
on jqueryui.com. The blog post will go out as soon as the changelog is
finished and Google's CDN is updated. **Reminder**: this is a legacy
compatibility release for anyone still needing to use jQuery UI with
jQuery 1.2.6, and will not be further developed. It is highly
recommended you upgrade to 1.7 as soon as possible.
