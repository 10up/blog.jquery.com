Sorry about the unplanned hiatus last week. Not sure how long I'm going
to be able to sustain this, but here we go again with another weekly
roundup of jQuery news...

### jQuery + Server-Side Solutions

A common complaint in the earlier days of jQuery was that there wasn't
enough information on how to integrate jQuery with server-side languages
(or frameworks), so it's nice to see a proliferation of tutorials in
this area. Here are a few of the recent ones:

-   ColdFusion: [Validating Common Email Domain Misspellings using
    ColdFusion and
    jQuery](http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/validating-common-email-domain-misspellings-using-coldfusion-and-jquery).
    Incorporates the [Autocomplete
    plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/).
-   ASP.NET: [Walkthrough: full example of using MvcContrib grid with
    jQuery
    datatable](http://blogs.msdn.com/paulwhit/archive/2009/03/28/walkthrough-full-example-of-using-mvccontrib-grid-with-jquery-datatable.aspx)
-   Ruby on Rails: [Add jQuery datagrids to your Rails
    applications](http://www.2dconcept.com/jquery-grid-rails-plugin)
-   PHP: [PHP Contact Form with JQuery
    Validation](http://www.raymondselda.com/php-contact-form-with-jquery-validation/)

### Plugins

-   Eric Garside's [jStore
    plugin](http://eric.garside.name/docs.html?p=jstore) "allows users
    to access a number of different client-side storage engines through
    a single, convenient interface."
-   Inspired by James Padolsey's article [Introducing:
    JSHTML](http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/introducing-jshtml/),
    Ben Nadel put together a [jQuery Comments() Plug-in To Access HTML
    Comments For DOM
    Templating](http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm?dax=blog:1563.view).
-   [Horizontal
    Accordion](http://www.portalzine.de/index?/Horizontal_Accordion):
    Just released 2.0 Alpha version.
-   [jqPlot](http://www.hacknack.com/jqplot/docs/files/usage-txt.html)
    now joins the popular [Flot plugin](http://code.google.com/p/flot/)
    as a fully client-side charting solution.
-   [jCart](http://conceptlogic.com/jcart/): a free jQuery/PHP-based
    shopping cart.

### Fun Stuff

Chris Barr used jQuery to create a fun little game, [Guessr: Guess the
Flickr Tag](http://chris-barr.com/entry/guessr_-_a_flickr_game/), which
also takes advantage of the [jQuery UI
ThemeRoller](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/). Don't forget to check
out [This Week in jQuery UI, vol.
6](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/04/this-week-in-jquery-ui-vol-6/).
