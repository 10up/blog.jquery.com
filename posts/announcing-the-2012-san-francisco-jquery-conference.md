It's that time of year again...time to talk about [the next jQuery
Conference](http://events.jquery.com)! Mark your calendars for June 28th
and 29th. By popular demand, the next jQuery Conference will be in San
Francisco proper (as opposed to Mountain View), at the fantastic [UCSF
Mission Bay Conference
Center](http://www.acc-missionbayconferencecenter.com/ "Mission May Conference Center").
If you *haven't* been to an event there before, some highlights:

-   Pretty much the best conference wifi we've ever worked with
-   Pretty much the best conference *food* we've ever eaten
-   Free flowing coffee, sodas and drinks all day long
-   Great space, with comfy seating, great AV, parking, easy access to
    public transit, space for partying, and so on and so on and so on

We're incredibly excited about the new space, and about the way the 2012
SF show is shaping up! We're going slightly smaller and single track
this year too, so things are a bit simplified, a lot more intimate, and
there's less general shuffling about. **[Registration is open now, and
space
is *extremely* limited](http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/). **Tickets
have sold out pretty quickly in the past, and there are about 150
tickets less than last time!

Call for Proposals
------------------

We've opened a [call for speaking
proposals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDhrQk12dmJRbFF0d2NlODFmcTQ2X0E6MQ "Call for Speaking Proposals"),
which will remain open until May 13th. We encourage any and all to
apply. In fact, we're borrowing a page from JSConf's playbook this year
and doing an "inverted" call:  you're encouraged to nominate your dream
speaker (or anyone else) for a speaking slot on the subject of your
choice. Of course, you're welcome to nominate yourself!  We love to
spice it up with new speakers, new topics, and pretty much whatever you
can think of. **[Submit a proposal

Sponsors
--------

Conferences are expensive. So is running an open source project. We
couldn't do *any* of it without your help and support… so listen up! If
you work for a company that's hiring, a company that wants some
developer publicity, or a company looking to help out and give back to
the community, send them our way. Take a look at [the conference
prospectus](http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/assets/files/jq-sf-2012-prospectus.pdf) if
you (or your bosses) are feeling generous :) Sponsorship benefits and
mega karma points are both up for grabs...

Training
--------

We're still on the lookout for a space for training in SF on Wednesday,
June 27th. If your company has a space, or you have an idea for a venue,
please [shoot us an email](mailto:events@jquery.org), and we'll be
eternally grateful. That's it for today, folks. Keep an eye out for
upcoming announcements about speakers, sponsors, training days and all
varieties of miscellany. We'll also be updating the conference site with
things like venue details and after parties, so keep an eye on that one
too. Lastly, as always, if you've got questions or comments, reach out
or leave a note here.
