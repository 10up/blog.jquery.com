[![jQuery
Summit](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/summit.png)](http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/jquery_summit/)

[Environments for Humans](http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/) is
running [a one-day, online
conference](http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/jquery_summit/)
focusing on jQuery. The conference will be on November 19th and will
feature a number of prominent members of the jQuery community, including
members of the jQuery team. The following talks are slated for the
[jQuery Summit](http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/jquery_summit/):

-   The State of jQuery - John Resig
-   Web Interface Essentials - Marc Grabanski
-   RIAs: Building for the Desktop with the Web - Jonathan Snook
-   Rich Interactivity, Simplified, with jQuery UI - Richard Worth
-   Refactoring jQuery - Jonathan Sharp
-   JavaScript for Designers - David McFarland
-   Building Robust jQuery Plugins - JÃ¶rn Zaefferer
-   jQuery Anti-Patterns for Performance & Compression - Paul Irish

While a number of these talks are reprisals from the recent jQuery
conference, this event is not being run by the jQuery project. That
being said, it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun, and we
encourage those that missed the conference in September to check it out.
All attendees will be receiving a free copy of the upcoming jQuery
Cookbook, from O'Reilly. Additionally a number of prizes will be given
away to attendees (books, DVDs, etc.). **[Register for the jQuery
