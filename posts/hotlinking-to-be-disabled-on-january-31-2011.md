Lately, we have noticed a significant increase in traffic from sites
that [hotlink](http://altlab.com/hotlinking.html "What is hotlinking?")
directly to files on our various properties (jquery.com, jqueryui.com,
dev.jquery.com, etc.) instead of downloading and hosting them locally or
taking advantage of the CDNs that we and others (Google, Microsoft,
etc.) provide for this purpose. This behavior has started to
negatively affect the performance of our network and is preventing
legitimate users from accessing our site at peak times. In order to
improve the performance and availability of our sites for all users, we
have disabled hotlinking to images across our entire network. We will be
disabling hotlinking to all other types of content (such as CSS and
JavaScript) at the end of January. **If your site is hotlinking to
jQuery domains other than code.jquery.com, please be aware that you must
update your site before this deadline or it will stop functioning
normally.** For information on upgrading your site to take advantage of
one of the available CDNs, or to download jQuery to host on your own
server, please visit: [Downloading
