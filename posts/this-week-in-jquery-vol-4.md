Here again is my somewhat arbitrary list of jQuery-related sightings on
the web this week.

### Featured jQuery App

The folks at Carsonified have just [released a beta of
Twiggy](http://www.carsonified.com/twiggy/twiggy-beta-released), an app
that searches Twitter from Nokia's widget-enabled phones Opera as a
widget. Widget apps are built in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and are
stored and executed locally. Twiggy lets you search Twitter and save
favorites. Elliott Kember, who along with Mike Kus is responsible for
creating Twiggy, describes their use of jQuery in the app:

> Twiggy uses jQuery for all the Javascript animations and layout
> changes. There are a few small widget-only APIs that interface with
> the phone, but I've used jQuery for the user interaction bits. I
> didn't end up using anything very complex or tricky due to the limited
> time frame, but I found that the phone handled animations really well.
> It'd be very interesting to design a much bigger app and take the
> phone to its limits.
>
> I used a Twitter jQuery plugin from http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/ and
> it worked just fine. I didn't use jQuery UI - but I'd be interested to
> see whether it worked on such a limited platform.
>
> I chose to use jQuery because it's familiar, reliable and fast. I
> didn't want to use custom little libraries and functions which might
> not work so well. I was really pleased to find that the N96, for one,
> runs jQuery really well in this runtime. I half-expected the rendering
> engine to be slow, or buggy, and shoe-horned into the phone somehow,
> but it's quite happily running a full, packed jQuery 1.3.2.

### Upcoming Conference

jQuery Project Team members Yehuda Katz and Brandon Aaron will be
presenting [jQuery on

Vegas.

### jQuery Game

A brand new game, [jQuery
Blackjack](http://sandbox.jquerylove.com/blackjack/) is now available on
a brand new site, [jQuery

jQuery, jQuery UI, and a ThemeRoller theme.
