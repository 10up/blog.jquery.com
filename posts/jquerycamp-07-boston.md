We're going to be having the first [all-day jQuery
mini-conference](http://docs.jquery.com/JQueryCamp07) October 27th, here
in Boston, MA. Already, a large portion of the [jQuery
team](http://docs.jquery.com/About/Contributors) will be attending and
giving talks - so if you're interested in meeting some of the people
who've helped to make jQuery possible and chatting with fellow
developers, then this is a fantastic place to do it! This event will be
immediately following the [Ajax Experience
conference](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/index.html). A
number of people are coming to both events, generally sponsored as
business travel by their employer. If you need any more details about
the events in order to coordinate that, please [let me
know](mailto:jeresig@gmail.com). Be sure to add yourself to the
[registration list](http://docs.jquery.com/JQueryCamp07) so that we know
how large of a venue to get. Hope to see everyone there! If you, or your
company, is interested in sponsoring this event, please contact [John
Resig](mailto:jeresig@gmail.com). We're generally looking for a couple
hundred dollars to help defray the cost of food - and if we get enough,
t-shirts for those who attend.
