About 4 days ago, many have noticed that we had uploaded another minor
bugfix release to our Google Code account. While there's, again, no new
API introduced, more than 30 issues have been cleared and the codebase
is growing more stable every day. The full changelog is available
[here](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Changelog/1.5.2) if you want to find
out if a specific issue has been addressed. As with 1.5.1, updating to
this version is highly recommended and likely not to break anything in
your written code. You can grab the latest release as always via the
downloader or as developer package at
[http://ui.jquery.com/download](http://ui.jquery.com/download) or if you
prefer, get it as latest tag from Subversion. As a last comment, this is
probably the last minor release before 1.6, which we will announce
before the end of July, so watch out for a couple of awesome new
components and enhancements soon! Have a nice day, Paul Bakaus & the
jQuery UI Team
