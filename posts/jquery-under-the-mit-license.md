jQuery is [now available](http://jquery.com/docs/License/), exclusively,
under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). This
license is much more open than the previous [Creative Commons
license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) used (and much
better suited to software development). In a nutshell, for those not
familiar with the MIT License, it's about as free as you can get without
actually putting something in the public domain. The only stipulation is
that you keep the copyright along with the source code, and everything
will be a-ok. Choosing this license was the result of a [long
discussion](http://jquery.com/discuss/2006-April/000623/) on the mailing
list, figuring out what was best for everyone, including all the
corporations that wanted to use it. If you have any questions as to how
this might effect you (note: It probably won't), just drop a note to the
[mailing list](http://jquery.com/discuss/) and we can help to set you
straight.
