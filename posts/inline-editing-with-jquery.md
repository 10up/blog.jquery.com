We've all heard of in-line editing. Flickr uses it for many things such
as changing the title or description of one of your pictures.

For those of you who dont know, in-line editing is when you can just
click on text, and it becomes a text box which the user can then edit.
When the user hits enter, the edited text is sent to a script, which can
do some magic, like submitting the text to a database.

Now, thanks to Dylan Verheul, doing this with jQuery could never be
easier. He has created a plugin called Editable, which makes it possible
to create in-line editing fields with one simple line of code.

    $(element).editable(url, options);

The source code, along with a (~~broken~~ fixed) demo can be seen
[here](http://www.dyve.net/jquery/?editable). I have put together a
simple working demo on my website,
