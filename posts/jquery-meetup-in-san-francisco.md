There are a few jQuery guys in San Francisco this week and we thought
it'd be fun to have a meetup. John Resig (Creator of jQuery), Rey Bango
(Head of jQuery Evangelism Team) and Yehuda Katz (Rails Core
Contributor, jQuery Team Member) will all be meeting up tomorrow night
(the 29th) if you want to say 'hi'. More information can be found on the
Upcoming.org site for the event - feel free to add yourself if you're
interested in coming:
