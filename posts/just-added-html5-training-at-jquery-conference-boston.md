The Boston conference is sold out (thanks everyone!), as is the Intro to
jQuery training session, but the requests keep coming! In response to
popular demand, [we've added a second training scheduled for Friday,
September 30th](http://events.jquery.org/2011/boston/register/). The
training will focus on HTML5, and be taught by jQuery Core Team Member
and Bocoup trainer Richard Worth. The price will be the same \$299
(which, if you've been paying attention to HTML5 training rates, is a
steal!). Here's some detail from the training description:

> HTML5 is the next major milestone in HTML and it's not just another
> incremental enhancement; it represents an enormous advance for modern
> web applications. A large number of HTML5 features are already
> supported in browsers, so it's time to start using them! In our HTML5
> for Programmers Workshop, you will learn how to create HTML5 web pages
> and web applications using semantic HTML5 markup and cross-browser
> HTML5 JavaScript APIs. After completing this course, students will:
>
> -   Know how to use semantic HTML5 Markup
> -   Know how to use cross-browser HTML5 JavaScript APIs
> -   Understand current browser support for the various HTML5 features
> -   Understand how to polyfill HTML5 features on older browsers
>
> Our training takes a step-by-step approach, solidifying fundamental
> concepts and building on them to leave each attendee with a more
> thorough understanding of HTML5. Using a 50% lecture / 50% lab format,
> attendees will be able to put the concepts they have just learned to
> use after each section.
>
> -   HTML5 Overview
> -   Using HTML5 Today
> -   Markup
> -   Forms
> -   Canvas
> -   Video and Audio
> -   Drag and Drop
> -   Geolocation
> -   Web Storage
> -   Web Workers
> -   Communication and Web Sockets
>
> This course is designed for software developers interested in
> designing, creating, and deploying HTML5 web applications. It is
> valuable to developers that already have experience in developing web
> applications. To get the most out of the course, you should be
> familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Prior exposure to any of
> these concepts will be helpful, but not required: AJAX, XML, jQuery,
> HTTP, REST.
