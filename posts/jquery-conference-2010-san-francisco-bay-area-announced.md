![Microsoft Silicon Valley Research

jQuery Project is very excited to announce the dates for our first-ever
San Francisco Bay Area conference. The conference will be held at the
[Microsoft Silicon Valley Research
Center](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/siliconvalley/)in
Mountain View, California on April 24th and 25th, 2010. The San
Francisco Bay Area conference is the second of four events planned by
the jQuery Project in 2010. The first was the
[jQuery14](http://jquery14.com) event, and additional conferences are
being planned in Europe and on the East Coast for later this year. This
venue is the largest that the project has worked with to date (Harvard
Law School in ‘07, the MIT Stata Center in ‘08 and Microsoft New England
Research Center in '09) and we expect to sell out very quickly.
Registration is currently scheduled to open on Wednesday, March 17th;
tickets will be priced at \$199. In addition to General Admission
tickets, we're offering a limited number of discounted student tickets
priced at \$99, with a valid student ID. **Watch the [jQuery
