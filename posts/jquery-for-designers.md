[Mark Panay](http://www.markpanay.com/) made a [good
post](http://www.markpanay.com/blog.html) today explaining the benefits
of using jQuery, for web designers. Specifically, how a designer can
benefit from using jQuery to circumvent CSS features that aren't
implemented in browsers, yet. Keep your extraneous markup tucked away as
unobtrusive Javascript is always a smart move.
