[Audun Wilhelmsen](http://www.bytetastic.com/) (skyfex), a jQuery user
who lives in Norway, recently attended [The
Gathering](http://www.gathering.org/), one of the largest computer
events in the world. While there, he competed in an
[Opera](http://opera.com/)-sponsored [widget development
contest](http://my.opera.com/widgets/blog/show.dml/189104). The new
[Opera 9 Beta](http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2006/04/20/) has a
whole widget framework, that's sure to challenge Yahoo! Widgets and OSX
Dashboard. Once the final analysis was done by the judges, they decided
that [Audun was the
winner](http://my.opera.com/widgets/blog/show.dml/223904). Not only is
this great news for him (he won a \$6000 mega gaming machine), but it
just goes to show how effective jQuery is for fast Javascript
development. Audun's winning application is called
[KnowledgeMate](http://my.opera.com/community/customize/widgets/info/?id=4024).
You enter your search into a single field, and it searches a number of
search engines simultaneously (including image search engines), and
returns the relevant results. It's very fast, looks sharp, and is quite
handy. I definitely recommend downloading the new Opera beta to give
this widget a try, if for nothing else. Congrats Audun!
