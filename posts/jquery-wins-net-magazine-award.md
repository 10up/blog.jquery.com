Word has just come in that jQuery has won the [2009 .Net Magazine
Award](http://www.thenetawards.com/) for best Open Source Application.
jQuery was in the final voting with Firefox and Wordpress. Simon
Willison graciously accepted the award for the team:

This award really goes out to the whole jQuery community and all the
contributors that made jQuery what it is today. Congratulations!
