We're nearing the final release of jQuery 1.5 - and we're pleased to
announce the release of the first release candidate! Barring any major
bugs this should be the code that we end up shipping for jQuery 1.5
(which will be happening on January 31st). The final release notes and
documentation will be coming with the final 1.5 release.

jQuery 1.5 Release Candidate 1
------------------------------

You can get the code from the jQuery CDN:

-   [http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5rc1.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5rc1.js)

You can help us by dropping that code into your existing application and
letting us know that if anything no longer works. Please [file a
bug](http://bugs.jquery.com/) and be sure to mention that you're testing
against jQuery 1.5 RC 1. We want to encourage everyone from the
community to try and [get
involved](http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved) in contributing back
to jQuery core. We've set up a [full
page](http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved) of information dedicated
towards becoming more involved with the team. The team is here and ready
to help you help us!
