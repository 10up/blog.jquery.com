Last night, [Bertrand Gugger](http://toggg.com/spip/), an active member
of the jQuery community (toggg on \#jquery) and frequent contributor of
[French jQuery articles and
translations](http://www.jquery.info/spip.php?page=recherche&recherche=toggg),
passed away. He was an active contributor to a [number of Open Source
projects](http://www.spip-contrib.net/Les-Projets-de-toggg)
([English](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spip-contrib.net%2FLes-Projets-de-toggg&langpair=fr|en&hl=en&ie=UTF8))
including [PEAR PHP](http://pear.php.net/user/toggg) and
[SPIP](http://www.spip.net/) (a PHP-based CMS). His generosity, caring,
and humor will be remembered, and missed, by us all.
