jQuery 1.4.3 Release Candidate 2 is released! This is the second release
candidate of jQuery 1.4.3. The code is stable (passing all tests in all
browsers we support), feature-complete (we're no longer accepting new
features for the release), and needs to be tested in live applications.
**Grab the code:**

-   Regular:
    [http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.3rc2.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.3rc2.js)
-   Minified:
    [http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.3rc2.min.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.3rc2.min.js)

**NOTE:** If you're using jQuery 1.4.3rc2 and you run into an error
please make sure that you're using the regular version of the code,
it'll make it easier to spot where the error is occurring. **How can I
help?** To start, try dropping the above un-minified version of jQuery
1.4.3rc2 into a live application that you're running. If you hit an
exception or some weirdness occurs immediately login to the bug tracker
and [file a bug](http://bugs.jquery.com/). **Be sure to mention that you
hit the bug in jQuery 1.4.3rc2!** We'll be closely monitoring the bug
reports that come in and will work hard to fix any inconsistencies
between jQuery 1.4.2 and jQuery 1.4.3. More details regarding the 1.4.3
release can be found in the previous post on [jQuery
1.4.3rc1](http://blog.jquery.com/2010/10/10/jquery-1-4-3-release-candidate-1-released/).
