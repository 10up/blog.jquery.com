If there's anything that's apparent from watching the jQuery mailing
list and jQuery-related blog posts on Technorati, it's that there's a
huge international audience for the library. As I've been working on the
new version of the web site (to be released together with the upcoming
version 1.0 of jQuery) I've had a number of offers from users to
translate documentation and blog posts into their native language. I
cannot express how pleased I am by this. I have two questions for all
the jQuery users out there: **If you are fluent in language other than
English, would you be willing to help translate alternate versions of
blog posts or documentation?** If you are, please respond to this post
so that I can get a feel for everyone who is interested and what
languages are represented. Secondly, if you speak a language other than
English (but may, or may not, be able to help translate), please let me
know what language you would like to see the jQuery site in:
**Which language should jQuery Documentation be in? (Besides English)**
German Spanish French Italian Japanese Chinese
Thank you, everyone, for your input - it's greatly appreciated. (by the
way, the [Internationalization](http://drupal.org/project/i18n) module
for [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) is very cool)
