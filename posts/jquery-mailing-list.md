Per the request of
[Mark](http://blog.jquery.com/2006/01/26/more-documentation/#comment-11)
(and many others) there is now an official [jQuery mailing
list](http://jquery.com/discuss/). I did some simple testing to make
sure that it worked properly, and it seems to be fairing well, so far.
Let me know if you spot any bugs signing up or posting messages. Feel
free to keep questions or discussions to the list and continue to send
support requests [directly to me](mailto:jeresig@gmail.com).
