Organizers
----------

The event is being organized by Oxford based digital agency [White
October](http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/) with the permission of the
jQuery project and with the help and support from jQuery team members.
Last year, the jQuery events team tried to put together an event outside
the USA and we found how very hard it was to secure a venue from so far
away. The jQuery Team is very happy to be working with White October in
putting the conference together, and we hope to have you join as we make
our European debut!
