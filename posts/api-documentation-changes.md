When we added comments to the API documentation last January, the idea
was to provide a place for members of the community to augment the
documentation with their own tips or real-world examples. While this
system worked well when it was first introduced, it has become
increasingly difficult to manage the enormous amount of spam that it has
attracted. We also found that many people were trying to use it as a
support system, which it was not designed to do. Because of this,**we’re
planning to turn off comments on the API site later this week in favor
of more directed feedback options**:

-   If you need help debugging your code or understanding how something
    works, or if you're interested in helping others, head to the
    [jQuery Forum](http://forum.jquery.com) or visit \#jquery on
    irc.freenode.net.
-   If you've found a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, please
    follow our [bug reporting
    guidelines](http://docs.jquery.com/How_to_Report_Bugs) and submit
    your report directly to our [bug tracker](http://bugs.jquery.com/).
-   If you notice an error or omission in our documentation and want to
    help us improve it, we’ll provide a simple contact form for you to
    fill out.

Once comments are disabled, members of the jQuery API subteam will scour
old comments for any information that we can, with the commenter’s
permission, roll into the documentation proper.

### Observations and Lessons Learned

Even though we'll be turning off the comment system, having it on the
site the past year was a valuable experience. Here are just a few of the
observations and lessons we noted along the way:

-   When bug reports, feature requests, and calls for help were left in
    comments, instead of in the bug tracker and forums, they didn't
    receive the attention they deserved.
-   When well-meaning people replied to requests for help in the wrong
    channel, they inadvertently contributed to the fragmentation of the
    community.
-   On the other hand, when people introduced and responded to topics in
    the appropriate channel, there was a much greater likelihood of
    successful resolution.
-   Instructions for writing appropriate comments were often overlooked,
    regardless of their size, location, or wording.
-   The value and accuracy of on-topic comments tends to wane over time
    as bug-fixes and enhancements are applied.
-   Knowing how and when to "prune" comments was a particularly tough
    challenge. For example, after we revised the wording in an entry to
    address a comment thread, we felt that deleting the thread was
    appropriate. Yet, we also regretted not being able to properly thank
    the people who helped out without contributing to comment noise.
-   If a plugin author plugs their project in the comments, is it spam?
    We didn’t have a good answer to this question, and many others like
    it, but that didn’t keep us from spending a lot of time stressing
    over the Right Way™ to handle these situations.

### Thanks to the jQuery API Sub-team
