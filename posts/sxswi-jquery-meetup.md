Right now the annual SXSWi conference is happening in beautiful, sunny,
Austin, Texas. Interestingly enough, there's a ton of jQuery users here
(as am I). I've already had the opportunity to talk with a number of
you, but we should really do a proper get together. As proposed by Luke
Lutman, on the mailing list, and Cody Lindley (of Thickbox fame) - let's
do a meetup! Let's say Monday (Mar 12th) at lunch. Meet at the main
doors facing the Courtyard Hotel. If you have any troubles, feel free to
give me a call at 585-615-5287 and I'll direct you in. I'm looking
forward to meeting everyone! **See Also:**

**Update:** Just to clarify, this is at 12:30pm (after the
11:30am-12:30pm session ends). And the doors are at the corner of
Trinity and and Fourth St. I'll be wearing a bright red Atari T-Shirt,
so I should be easy to spot.
