The jQuery Plugins site had been experiencing a few issues lately. So,
today I moved it to its new home,
[http://plugins.jquery.com](http://plugins.jquery.com). If you've got a
plugin hosted on the jQuery Plugins site, please give your plugin a look
and make sure everything is where it should be. If you have any issues,
please submit them to the [jQuery Plugins Website Issue
Queue](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquerypluginswebsite).
