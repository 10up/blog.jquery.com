Some [recent](http://www.wait-till-i.com/index.php?p=366)
[articles](http://www.webstandards.org/2006/12/12/reducing-the-pain-of-adopting-a-javascript-library/)
have discussed the need for having "really good" tutorials for
JavaScript libraries. As always, we're working to make the jQuery
documentation better and more useful, so I want to pose the following
question: **What are some tutorials that would help you better use or
learn jQuery?** Make sure it's something simple (like "Building a
drop-down menu.") and not something really complex (like "Building a
complete shopping cart system"). Feel free to post your suggestions here
in the comments, it'll help to give us a good idea of what people want
and what needs better explaining. We've recently started working on the
reorganization of the [jQuery documentation
wiki](http://jquery.com/docs/). Right now it's quite messy and all over
the place. As you can see from the [new wiki's
structure](http://docs.jquery.com/), however, is that we're going for a
much more thorough representation of jQuery itself. Within each of these
topics we want to include a number of useful "common case" tutorials
that will help you to better understand the functions in the jQuery API.
So please: (Taking into account what you see of the [new
wiki's](http://docs.jquery.com/) structure) **What would help you better
learn, and use, jQuery?**
