Here's some holiday cheer: [Flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/), a new
plotting library/plugin for jQuery by Ole Laursen. The initial 0.1
release has some stunning features, including interactivity with your
charts. Flot looks very promising, and we like to highlight promising
developments in the jQuery community!
