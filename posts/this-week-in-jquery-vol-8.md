Another week, another collection of links to some of the most
interesting and exciting new jQuery happenings around the web. If you
have ever used a [regular expression tool to highlight character
matches](http://www.gskinner.com/RegExr/) in real time, then you'll jump
for joy when I tell you about the [Interactive jQuery selector
tester](http://www.woods.iki.fi/interactive-jquery-tester.html) written
by Samuli KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen. You enter a selector expression, and in real
time you get to see the elements in the DOM structure that have been
selected. I can see this being very handy for complex expressions or for
optimizing expressions down to the simplest solution. Also, in case you
didn't notice, the [second maintenance release for jQuery UI 1.7 is
out](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/06/jquery-ui-172/?dzref=192790).

Resig himself, talking at the up and coming
[devdays](http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/tickets.html). And the
really juicy part is they might be wearing a [DEVO red energy
dome](http://www.kungfunation.com/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&cPath=999&products_id=613).

### jQuery Quote of the Week

"You can save a tremendous amount of time and effort by using the
browser-independent framework that JQuery has spent untold man-hours
testing, debugging, and proving in the field. While there's nothing
wrong with writing JavaScript, why not speed your development time by
writing to the library instead? As I've always said, don't reinvent the
wheel, unless you plan on learning more about wheels. " - [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001275.html)
