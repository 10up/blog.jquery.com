![Digg-like Spy with
jQuery](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/jspy.png)
[Remy Sharp](http://leftlogic.com/info/articles) has [just
released](http://leftlogic.com/info/articles/jquery_spy) a new jQuery
plugin which allows you to emulate the, very cool,
[Spy](http://digg.com/spy/) feature of [Digg](http://digg.com/). For
those who are unfamiliar, the [Spy](http://digg.com/spy/) feature of
[Digg](http://digg.com/) has stories fade in, in real time, as people
vote, moderate, or comment, on them. It's a very slick feature for
checking the pulse on the Digg community. Remy has taken that Digg Spy
concept and created [a jQuery
plugin](http://leftlogic.com/info/articles/jquery_spy) that
automatically pulls new items (using AJAX) from the server and
gracefully fades them in. Additionally, it fades out the old items that
don't matter as much, any more. As proof of how easy it is to use this,
another Digg user has already taken the plugin and [implemented it on
his own site](http://www.arsenal-now.com/spy/articles.html), which is
quite impressive given the short amount of time that this has been out.
If you like this plugin, you should [Digg Remy's
article](http://digg.com/programming/How_to_create_a_Digg_like_spy_with_no_work_at_all),
as I'm sure a lot of Digg users would really like their own Spy to play
around with.
