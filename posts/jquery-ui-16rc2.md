Hey everyone, I'm glad to announce that finally, we decided to kick out
a release candidate of jQuery UI 1.6. It's called rc2, because we pushed
out a rc1 too early on Monday, and to everyone who downloaded that one
or another early version of 1.6, a upgrade to 1.6rc2 is highly
recommended. This is also the final version before the real deal, which
can be expected to follow in the next days. 1.6rc2 is mainly a bugfix
and stability release, and we made sure again you can read what has
changed in our [changelog](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Changelog/1.6) for
1.6, which shows the current state.

### Download multiple versions, public dev group

In addition to all the bugfixes, we also have a couple of new hot things
to check out:

-   **You can now decide wether you want to download the stable or
    unstable version in the [download
    builder](http://ui.jquery.com/download).** This is a big one,
    because for the first time, users have the possibility to decide
    what to download using the convienient interface.
-   **The [jquery-ui-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui-dev)
    list has been opened to the public**. This is also a big change,
    because it means you can now actively participate in the development
    of jQuery UI, by simply participating in the discussions, and we
    highly encourage you to do so!

### New servers

Finally, we're currently doing a transition to a new, dedicated server
for jQuery UI, and all the other jQuery subdomains also receive new
servers. This will give the UI homepage and the documentation major
performance boosts in the next days. Now go to
[http://ui.jquery.com/download](http://ui.jquery.com/download) and grab
jQuery UI 1.6rc2! See you, Paul Bakaus & the jQuery UI Team
