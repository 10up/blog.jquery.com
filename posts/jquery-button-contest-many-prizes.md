To encourage people to promote the jQuery project, and get as many
people involved in the community as possible, we're holding a contest to
build a **"Powered by jQuery" button**. Having a nicely designed button
will be a good way for jQuery users to build more awareness about the
project, while having something that looks cool on your site! **The
Rules:**

1.  The contest will run until November 3rd. Winners will be announced
    November 5th.
2.  All entries must must be optimized for the web (8-bit PNG) and
    images should be no bigger than 173x31
    ([example](http://www.reybango.com/images/poweredByBD5H.gif)).
3.  The jQuery team will have the right to the use the submissions
    anyway they wish. This will prevent any copyright issues in the
    future. The winner must also be able to provide a PSD (or AI) file
    so that the image can be maintained in the future.
4.  Prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place submissions.
5.  The general jQuery community will do the final voting, moderated by
    [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/), creator of jQuery, and [Rey
    Bango](http://reybango.com/).
6.  You should make use of the [jQuery hat
    logo](http://jquery.com/images/new/hat.gif) in your button (you're
    free to re-draw it, as necessary). If needed, here's a [raw PSD of
    the hat logo](http://jquery.com/images/new/hat.psd).

**The Prizes:**

1.  **First Place Prize**: Two Books - [Ajax Design
    Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Design-Patterns-Michael-Mahemoff/dp/0596101805/)
    and John Resig's upcoming [Pro JavaScript
    Techniques](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-JavaScript-Techniques-John-Resig/dp/1590597273/)
2.  **Second Place Prize**: One Book - [Foundations of
    Ajax](http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Ajax-Foundation-Ryan-Asleson/dp/1590595823/)
3.  **Third Place Prize**: \$10 Cash to a PayPal account of your
    choosing!

The prizes will be shipped anywhere in the world via regular post. All
submissions should be made in the comment section of this posting via a
standard hyperlink. Make sure that you provide a valid email address
when submitting your entry. This is your chance to really help expand
the jQuery community by creating a top notch button that will get a ton
of exposure. Good luck to everyone!
