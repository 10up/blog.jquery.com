A couple days late to press this week. Friday and Saturday were filled
with the first ever JavaScript Conference, [JSConf
2009](http://jsconf2009.com/). What a weekend! jQuery UI was represented
by Scott González and myself (Richard Worth). Scott gave a presentation
on creating a widget using the jQuery UI widget factory. I did an
introduction to jQuery UI.

### Releases

I mentioned the jQuery UI 1.6 release last week as it was available for
download. Now the full
[changelog](http://jqueryui.com/docs/Changelog/1.6) and [blog
post](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/04/jquery-ui-16/) are out. Next up
is 1.7.2. We made some progress on that during the sprint. A few more
issues to wrap up, and that should be out this week. Speaking of the
sprint, thanks to all that participated.

### Design & Development

With 1.6 finalized and 1.7 nearing a freeze, the jQuery UI team is
shifting focus to 1.8 and beyond. With the recent [plugin
prioritization](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Prioritizing-plugins), we
updated the [planned plugins
list](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/#plugins-list) on the [Dev & Planning
wiki home](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/). Our focus is currently on the
high priority plugins. Please take a look at those plugin pages and see
if we've missed anything. If you have ideas about each plugin's
requirements, design, or specifications, feel free to edit the page, or
leave a comment. If you've don't have a wiki account, there's a link at
the top to request access. We'd love your input.

### Sites Using jQuery UI

We maintain a list of [Sites Using jQuery
