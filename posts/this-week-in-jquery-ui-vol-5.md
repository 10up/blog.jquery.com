### Releases and the Sprint

We pushed everything back one week. So the 1.6 final release will be
next Wed. April 15th. The sprint will be next Friday and Saturday, April
17th and 18th, in preparation for the 1.7.2 release on Wed. April 22nd.
We've created a wiki page for the sprint to start the planning:
[http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Worldwide-Sprint-2](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Worldwide-Sprint-2)
You're invited to sign up there if you plan to join, even if just for an
hour. Also, there will be a full sprint blog post on Monday with more
details.
