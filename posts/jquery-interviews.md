People are really starting to pick up on the "jQuery thing"! I've given
a number of interviews and presentations lately concerning jQuery. Here
are most of the interviews: One for a magazine, two for online articles,
and one podcast. Enjoy! [eWeek: jQuery Eases JavaScript, AJAX
Development](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2010602,00.asp)

> As more developers adopt the practice of AJAX-style development to
> create more interactive applications, they are looking for tools to
> make the job easier. One such tool is jQuery, which some users say
> makes AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) development cleaner by
> making using JavaScript easier. JavaScript is notoriously difficult to
> work with, said a group of experts at Microsoft's Lang.Net symposium
> in early August, in Redmond, Wash.

[Drupal Podcast: jQuery Author John
Resig](http://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podast_no_21_jquery_author_john_resig)

> We've just posted the 21st episode of the Drupal Podcast! It is an
> interview with JQuery author, John Resig. We talk about what JQuery
> is, how it works, and how it will fit into Drupal.

[.net Magazine: John Resig of
jQuery](http://rikrikrik.com/log/jquery-interview)

> Most of the â€œbigâ€? updates to jQuery are going to be community
> related. Iâ€™m now working with a number of international jQuery users
> who will be translating the documentation and the siteâ€™s blog posts
> into other languages; most likely German, Chinese, Spanish, Italian,
> and French to start with. Additionally, since jQuery has an incredibly
> easy plugin architecture, Iâ€™m also working on improving the overall
> developer community and organization â€“ think Sourceforge for jQuery.

[InfoWorld: JavaScript, .Net developers aided in separate
projects](http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/31/HNjscriptsandcastle_1.html)

> In the JavaScript arena, the open source jQuery project provides
> developers with a JavaScript library to improve the quality of Web
> applications. JQuery makes it easier to write JavaScript and AJAX
> (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), said John Resig, lead developer of
> jQuery and also an author. "The big thing that makes it different form
> other JavaScript libraries is it doesn't really try to impose itself
> on you," Resig said. Developers should be able to write shorter code
> than before while still getting equal if not better functionality, he
> said.
