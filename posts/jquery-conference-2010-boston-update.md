The jQuery Conference in Boston is fast approaching and we are
officially sold out.  Thank you so much for your support it’s going to
be a great event.  For those that are coming there is some venue
information on the [Events home
page](http://events.jquery.org/2010/boston) if you are still looking for
a cheaper hotel or if your driving to the venue, there is some parking
information you’ll need to be aware of. **Sponsors** We are still
looking for last minute
[sponsors](http://events.jquery.org/2010/boston/sponsors/).  Last minute
sponsors are our favorite sponsors! Why sponsor?  The jQuery Conference
is supported by our generous Sponsors and Donors, without whom things
would be very different. The jQuery Conference is a great way to get
your message out to 500+ highly qualified influential technology
decision makers; if you or your company are interested, [download our
prospectus for more
information](http://events.jquery.org/2010/boston/assets/pdf/jQuery_Boston_2010_Prospectus_8-31.pdf).
We are willing to talk with you about a package that would work for you.
 Contact information can be found on the prospectus. **Training Class
Seats Still Available** I did want to remind everyone about our training
class we are holding before the conference. We still have openings for
the training class and it is separate from the conference. In San
Francisco, the training class was ran by
[appendTo](http://appendto.com/) and it was a great success.  In Boston,
the class will be run by [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/), a Boston
JavaScript Company.  Here are some of the details about the class.
