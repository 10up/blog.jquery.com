I'm quite pleased with the results, there's a good mix of sizes and
styles - a little something for everyone. If each of the winners could
[contact me](mailto:jeresig@gmail.com), we'll arrange for your prizes
right away. Remember: Even if your [favorite
entry](http://blog.jquery.com/2006/10/26/jquery-button-contest-many-prizes/)
didn't win, that doesn't mean that you can't use it to promote jQuery.
On another note: The redesign (and reorganization) of the jQuery web
site is in full swing. There are a couple professional web designers who
are graciously donating their time to make the new site come alive.
Expect to see some more updates on this front very soon. I'd like to,
again, thank everyone for participating - this has been a fantastic
contest. I'm immensely pleased, and I hope you are too!
