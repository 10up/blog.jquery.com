I've just finished writing up some more documentation, to help everyone
who's learning how to use jQuery. I'd like to thank Bruno for helping me
sort out all the Prototype/jQuery weirdness and Derek for looking at the
selector differences.

-   [jQuery Base Module](http://jquery.com/docs/base/). I wrote up how
    exactly the \$() function works and broke up the documentation for
    all the individual function-types into separate pages.
-   [jQuery Selectors](http://jquery.com/docs/BaseExpression/). One of
    the most important parts of jQuery is its ability to quickly select
    different HTML elements. This page shows how this works and how CSS
    and XPath can play nicely together.
-   [Using CSS with jQuery](http://jquery.com/docs/CSS/). This page
    details the similarities and differences between the CSS 1-3
    specifications and how they're implemented in jQuery.
-   [Using XPath with jQuery](http://jquery.com/docs/XPath/). An
    explanation of what basic aspects of XPath are supported, on top of
    CSS.
-   [Custom Selectors](http://jquery.com/docs/CustomExpressions/). A
    number of custom selectors were introduced, that weren't readily
    available in either CSS or XPath.
-   [Using Prototype and
    jQuery](http://jquery.com/docs/PrototypeAndJQuery/). Finally,
    detailed documentation on how jQuery works when used with Prototype,
    what to be careful of, and what to look out for.

My next big step with jQuery is to tune up some of the code, for speed
and clarity, (thanks Tim!), write a couple new plugins, and create the
new plugin repository for developers to use. All of these should be
coming out within the next couple days/weeks.
