This is the first in a weekly series on what's happening with jQuery UI.
It will be a digest of all activity in the community and on the team.

### Releases

#### jQuery UI 1.7

Our latest release came out a week ago today. Here's some coverage I saw

Great feedback in a lot of comments on those posts. We're listening. I
was happy to see some positive feedback on the fact that themes can now
be downloaded in a bundle. Here's one example:

> Hoy es mi día. Me siento como si fuera mi cumpleaños y me estuvieran
> regalando el juego que llevo esperando tres meses.

My Spanish is only so-so. Here's the best google's language tools could
do:

> Today is my day. I feel like it was my birthday and I were giving away
> the game I been waiting three months.

#### jQuery UI 1.6rc2.5

This release has only been out two days, but so far there have been zero
comments on it, on the [blog post
announcement](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/03/jquery-ui-16rc25/) and on
the [mailing
lists](http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui/browse_thread/thread/65826e2db8d6c576).
Also, no bugs last I checked. Has anyone tried it out? The plan is to
release the final on March 25. If no error reports come in, 1.6rc2.5
will become 1.6 final. If that matters to you, please help kick it
around and be sure to file a bug report with the version specified as
'1.6rc2.5'. Thanks.

### Q&A with jQuery UI Creator Paul Bakaus

Steve Reynolds has posted an interview with Paul Bakaus. Here's the
intro:

> creator of jQuery UI has kindly agreed to answer some questions about
> that launch, his life as a programmer, his involvement with the jQuery
> UI project and the world as he knows it.

    iCal, Blog Badges, jQuery UI controls, OpenID and more in the coming

### Jobs

This is the first job listing I've seen that lists experience with
jQuery UI (not just jQuery) as a requirement:

> I am looking for a designer experienced with jQuery UI and CSS to help
> us design a nice reusable template that is sports related.

### Discussion

A lot of people are bummed that jQuery UI's nice rounded corners don't
work in Internet Explorer. Some discussion of this continued this week:

> I’m getting increasingly enthusiastic all the time with the jQuery UI
> framework - especially its well-structured and versatile CSS
> component. My emerging problem, however, seems to be one of designer
> acceptance. JQuery UI uses the -moz-border-radius CSS property to
> render its rounded corners in dialogs, controls and icons. This is a
> CSS3 standard and is supported in all upcoming browser versions…
> except Internet Explorer.

### Design & Development

We've had a lot of great activity this week on the [jQuery UI
Development & Planning wiki](http://wiki.jqueryui.com) as well as on the
[jQuery UI Dev Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui-dev). We can always use
more help, and we invite you to join us. Request access to the wiki,
review a page, leave a comment. Let us know if you have a plugin you
think might be a good fit for jQuery UI.
