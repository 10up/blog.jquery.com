full details on whatâ€™s included in this release.

### New Plugins

In addition to a number of bug fixes, this release adds three new
plugins:

-   [Position](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Position)
-   Stackfix (update: later removed, changed back to bgigframe)
-   zIndex

Please help us test these out and beat them up. The plan is to have one
more alpha releases, and then two beta releases. New plugins may be
added still before the first beta. The plugins in the first 1.8 beta
will be the plugins in 1.8 final.

### Thanks

A big thanks to all that have worked on creating these new plugins,
incorporating them into this release, as well as all the bug fixes and
other improvements that have gone into this release.
