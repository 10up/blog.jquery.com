Another week, another collection of links to some of the most
interesting and exciting new jQuery happenings around the web.

### Plugins

-   JÃ¶rn Zaefferer's wildly popular Validation plugin just got [updated
    to version
    1.5.2](http://bassistance.de/2009/03/20/release-validation-plugin-152/),
    which includes a [slick
    demo](http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/tabs/) of the
    plugin's integration with jQuery UI Tabs.
-   [DataTables](http://www.datatables.net/usage): uses "progressive
    enhancement" to convert a static HTML table into a much more dynamic
    data table.
-   [UI.Layout](http://layout.jquery-dev.net/): allows you to "create
    any UI look you want - from simple headers or sidebars, to a complex
    application with toolbars, menus, help-panels, status bars,
    sub-forms." While *not* a part of the [jQuery
    UI](http://ui.jquery.com/) project, you can combine it with jQuery
    UI widgets "to create a sophisticated application."

### Tutorials and Blog Entries

-   Brandon Aaron wrote an informative article about jQuery's [Special

announced a [three-day jQuery training
course](http://ideafoundry.info/jquery) in Holland, Michigan, May 13-15.
I'll be leading the training.

### Fun Experiment

Kelvin Luck has put together a really cool proof of concept using
jQuery/JavaScript. He calls it
[boingPic](http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/boingPic/index.html)
and describes it as "a simple experiment using javascript and jQuery
which allows you to make an image of your choice all boingy." Find out
