### Releases

No releases this week. The 1.7.2 release was rescheduled for Apr. 15.

### Plugin Prioritization

The [jQuery UI Team](http://jqueryui.com/about) completed a
[prioritization](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Prioritizing-plugins) this
week. This is the second time we've completed this process. The first
was in late 2008, when we changed the direction of the 1.6 and 1.7
releases, and focused on ThemeRoller v2 and the jQuery UI CSS Framework.
The [Development & Planning wiki home page](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/)
has been updated with the priority column for each plugin. We welcome
any help in getting these plugins designed and built over the next
couple of months. Note that this priority is not tied directly to our
release cycle. This means the 1.8 release will not necessarily contain
the plugins that currently have the highest priority. But it gives us as
a team some focus and sequencing. For example, there are a number of
high priority utility plugins right now that we're tackling first
because they're dependencies of a number of medium priority widgets. So
we need to design and build them first.

### Save The Date: jQuery UI Sprint

We're planning a sprint for next Thu.-Sat. (Apr. 9-11). It will all be
online, and anyone is welcome to participate as little or as much as
they're able. More details to come next week.
