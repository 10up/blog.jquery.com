Recently [Plazes](http://plazes.com/) (a popular geolocation web
application) put up a redesign of their service. If you take a peek at
how it's doing it's cool effects, underneath the hood, you'll see that
it's making good use of jQuery. The best place to see it in action is on
the [Plazes People](http://plazes.com/people/) page. The purpose of the
page is to allow you to browse around and see what other people are
connected and where they're currently located. This page has a number of
cool features that you can play around with:

-   Try moving/zooming the map - the list of people on the left-hand
    side of the screen will dynamically change and reload.
-   In the input box at the top of the map, enter in part of a city name
    and it will auto-complete it with the most relevant name.
-   Clicking a user in the left-hand menu will take you to where they're
    located on the map.

All in all, it's a great example of what's possible with jQuery, Google
Maps, and a [great dev
team](http://jquery.com/discuss/2006-April/000597/) to tie it all
together.
