[Cody Lindley](http://codylindley.com/) just released a brand new
version of
[Lightbox](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/)/[Greybox](http://amix.dk/projects/?page_id=5)
called
[Thickbox](http://codylindley.com/Javascript/257/thickbox-one-box-to-rule-them-all).
This release offers some great, added, functionality over the other
libraries. Specifically, this release is completely unobtrusive - it
uses the natural href, src, and title attributes to seed the box, when
it pops up. Even if you don't have Javascript enabled, it still behaves
naturally. It is also capable of dynamically loading blocks of html and
displaying it in the overlay. In all, it's a great release, not the
least of which is the fact that it uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to
pull it all together. So check it out, [play with
it](http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/), and let Cody know what you think
of it!
