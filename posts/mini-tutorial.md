I've been digging through my referrer logs and Technorati to see who's
talking about jQuery. Today I ran across someone who wrote [a quick
tutorial](http://www.juixe.com/techknow/index.php/2006/01/29/jquery-library/)
on how to use jQuery. The tutorial, itself, is rather new (e.g. nothing
immediately borrowed from the docs) - so if you're looking for some more
sample code, in addition to the [current
tutorial](http://jquery.com/docs/Tutorial/), this is another place to
look.
