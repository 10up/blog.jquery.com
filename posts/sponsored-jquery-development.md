Excellent news today: [Paul Bakaus](http://www.pb-projects.de/) has
received sponsorship from his employer, [New Identity
AG](http://www.newidentity.de/), to contribute back to jQuery project.
He's being given a chunk of hours under which he is sponsored to develop
jQuery-related code. All of this is going straight back in to the
community. This is in addition to the fact that [New Identity
AG](http://www.newidentity.de/) is in the process of making some major
switches over to using jQuery as their primary JavaScript library. They
have a number of [high profile
clients](http://www.newidentity.de/en/projects/clients/index.html) that
they develop for. Paul is going to begin by undertaking a number of
tasks that have been "in the works", namely: [A Prototype support
plugin](http://jquery.com/dev/bugs/bug/137/), [Cross-browser utility
methods](http://jquery.com/dev/bugs/bug/184/), and improved
functionality and bug fixes for
[Interface](http://interface.eyecon.ro/). This is a clear sign of a
couple things: That jQuery's German user-base is growing quite well,
that development will move at an even quicker pace now, and that
Interface is becoming an integral part of the full "jQuery package."
Expect to see some important updates in the pipeline, soon.
