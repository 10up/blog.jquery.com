An amazing new jQuery resource has just arrived: [15 Days of
jQuery](http://15daysofjquery.com/). It's a new site run by [Jack
Born](http://www.jackborn.com/), devoted to providing simple tutorials
for getting you started using jQuery. Jack created this site after using
jQuery in his projects:

> I consider [jQuery] the Swiss Army knife of Javascript - it's small,
> versatile, and has almost zero learning curve... If you're not a black
> belt in advanced javascript code by the end of these tutorials then
> you get 110% of your money back.

So far he has four tutorials up for you to browse but he's planning on
going up to the whole 15, during these next two weeks. After that, Jack
is going to continue exploring and making posts - so you should
[subscribe](http://15daysofjquery.com/feed/) now while it's still young!
This is absolutely a phenomenal resource for anyone new to jQuery, or
Javascript programming. I especially liked the [Zebra
Striping](http://15daysofjquery.com/examples/zebra/index.html) tutorial,
it walks you through how to perform a common activity easily and simply
with jQuery.
