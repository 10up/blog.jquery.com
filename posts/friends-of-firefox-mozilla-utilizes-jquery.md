Mozilla just released
[http://www.worldfirefoxday.com/](http://www.worldfirefoxday.com/), a
site to thank everyone who contributed in world firefox day 2006. The
site allows users to search for friends names and they are displayed in
an interesting fashion. The script is a combination of the
[Rotator](http://www.willjessup.com/sandbox/jquery/rotator/rotator.html)
script and some slick
[AutoComplete](http://www.dyve.net/jquery/?autocomplete) which powers
the search. Start typing a name slowly to see the results being filtered
and loaded into the rotator in real time. Then, if the results number
more than 20, you are able to "page" through them. The script supports a
"previous" button, but it has been hidden.
