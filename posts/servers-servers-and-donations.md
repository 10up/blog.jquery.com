The jQuery services are mostly back to normal now, John has since moved
the jQuery SVN to Google Code and is working to move the remaining
mailing lists to Google Groups. So, the most important parts have
weathered the recent server move, no problem. Of course, moving
providers when a dedicated server is required usually brings with it a
significant investment of capital. With that, we wanted to thank the
jQuery community for springing to life and donating generously to help
with the transition. In fact, the donations completely cover the initial
cost of the new server. Obviously, we don't really push for donations
around here, so it's great to see so many lend a helping hand. Thank you
all. And now for some extra-good news! ![MT hearts

[Media Temple](http://www.mediatemple.net/) has stepped up to donate a
great hosting package, to jQuery, complete with the industry-recognized
support reputation preceding them. We anticipate being fully
up-and-running on their hardware in the coming months, and welcome this
new partnership and the benefits it will bring the jQuery community.
