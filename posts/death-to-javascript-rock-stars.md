today, about the new jQuery site redesign and one thing has become
clear:

### Death to JavaScript Rock Stars!

Poor dude didn't even last 24 hours. We wanted to have some fun with the
home page, but this bordered on a little too "extreme" for most tastes.
We plan on bringing some further revisions to the homepage in the
future, but in the meantime here's a quick overhaul, put together by the
always-excellent [Scott Jehl](http://www.scottjehl.com/v7/), that'll
help tide everyone over:

As a token of our appreciation for sticking with the "JavaScript Rock
Star" for a day we've included a little Easter Egg in the new site. It
would be useful if you knew the [Konami
Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code). Naturally, the whole
redesign still has many tweaks that'll be made over the next couple
weeks, especially to individual page fonts, font sizes, and colors. I
want to, once again, thank Scott Jehl for all the hard work that he's
been putting in to the site design - and the excellent Varick Rosete (of
[nGenWorks](http://www.ngenworks.com/) and [Happy
Webbies](http://www.happywebbies.com)) for the great illustration that
he drew for us. Here's to many happy days of rockin' out with jQuery!
