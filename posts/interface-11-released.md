The ever-popular, jQuery-based, Drag-and-Drop, Animation, and Widget
library, [Interface](http://interface.eyecon.ro/) has [just released
version 1.1](http://interface.eyecon.ro/news) to coincide with the
release of jQuery 1.1.

[![Interface Color
Picker](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/color_picker.png)](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/slider_colorpicker.html)

A couple things to note about this release:

-   The brand new animateClass, animateStyle, and animateColor handlers.
    You can now do an animation from one particular class, to another -
    and from one color, to another.
-   The speed of droppables and sortables has been vastly improved.
-   The documentation has been overhauled and is quite comprehensive
    now.
-   The [download area](http://interface.eyecon.ro/download) has been
    reworked, and is completely interactive.
-   There's a ton of [demos](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos) to see.
    They've updated a bunch of the existing ones and added in some hot
    new ones, like: [Color
    Picker](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/slider_colorpicker.html),
    [Image Cropper](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/resize.html),
    [Panorama View](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/drag_vr.html), and
    a [Folder
    tree](http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/drag_drop_tree.html).

All-in-all, this is a fantastic release. If you haven't taken the
opportunity to check out Interface yet, I recommend that you do now.
