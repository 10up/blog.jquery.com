As the jQuery project has grown, so have the needs of the developer
community. As a project, we’re focused on building the best features
possible and providing them in a reliable and open manner. Like most
open-source projects, the software we’re able to offer is in no small
part due to the generosity of many volunteers who donate their time and
coding skills to make jQuery and jQuery UI some of the most widely used
JavaScript libraries available. In March, [we announced at MIX 2010 that
Microsoft had committed to supporting the jQuery
Project](http://blog.jquery.com/2010/03/16/microsoft-to-expand-its-collaboration-with-the-jquery-community/)
via code contributions and resources. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft made
available for public review their first jQuery plugin which provided
client-side templating capabilities to the jQuery community. This was
soon followed by their second plugin, jQuery Data Link, which offered
data synchronization capabilities and, most recently, the jQuery
Globalization plugin which offers globalization information to
JavaScript applications for over 350 cultures ranging from Scottish
Gaelic, Frisian, Hungarian, Japanese, to Canadian English. During the
seven months of development, the jQuery and Microsoft teams worked
closely to ensure that the code conformed to the best practices
specified by the jQuery project and filled specific needs of the jQuery
community. We also ensured that any code contributed would be available
to the jQuery community under the same non-restrictive licensing terms
as the jQuery JavaScript Library.

Official jQuery Plugins
-----------------------

Today, we’re very happy to announce that the following
Microsoft-contributed plugins - **the jQuery Templates plugin**, **the
jQuery Data Link plugin**, and **the jQuery Globalization plugin** –
have been accepted as officially supported plugins of the jQuery
project. As supported plugins, the jQuery community can feel confident
that the plugins will continue to be enhanced and compatible with future
versions of the jQuery and jQuery UI libraries. The jQuery Templates and
jQuery Datalink plugin will be managed by the jQuery Core team while the
jQuery Globalization plugin will become part of the jQuery UI project,
allowing for extended globalization functionality for our rich UI
library. In addition, the functionality found in the jQuery Templates
plugin will be directly integrated into the jQuery Core library starting
with version 1.5.

New Contribution Vehicle

We'd like to thank [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) for their
commitment to helping the jQuery Project and providing new and exciting
functionality for the jQuery libraries. This has been a rewarding
experience for both teams, laying the foundation for future
collaboration and creating a new path for meeting the needs of the
jQuery community. Please be sure to read Microsoft's joint announcement
outlining the history of the effort and the importance of these
contributions to Microsoft and the jQuery community: [jQuery Templates,
