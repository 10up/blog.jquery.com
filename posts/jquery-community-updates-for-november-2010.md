**Welcome to the November jQuery Community Update.** We hope you enjoyed
yesterday's special
[spotlight](http://blog.jquery.com/2010/11/23/team-spotlight-the-jquery-bug-triage-team/)
on the jQuery Bug Triage team. In this month's community update we'll be
looking at updates from the jQuery team, important announcements and a
new spotlight section where we highlight some of the jQuery articles
that we think you'd find useful. Let's dive right in! **jQuery won the
Packt Publishing award for best Open Source JavaScript Library** We are
pleased to announce that this month jQuery won the Open Source
JavaScript Libraries category in the 2010 Open Source Awards. On behalf
of the entire jQuery Team we would like to express our thanks to the
community of designers and developers that use jQuery daily and felt the
urge to vote for jQuery as their favorite JavaScript library. We would
also like to thank Packt Publishing for the award itself. We'll be using
this prize to further the development of the jQuery Project. [[Read

applications. One of the exciting developments that were announced

**New jQuery UI and Mobile Releases For November** In case you missed
it, jQuery UI 1.8.6 was released earlier this month. Along with official
support for jQuery 1.4.3, this update included bug fixes and
enhancements for jQuery UI Core, the Widget Factory, the Mouse widget
and the Position utility as well as the Accordion, Autocomplete, Button,
Datepicker, Dialog, Progressbar, and Tabs widgets and you should
definitely check it out. For more about this release check out the
following link:

Our third milestone release for jQuery UI 1.9 is also now out. This
features the new Spinner widget (currently in active development) and
also includes significant updates to the Tooltip and Menu widgets.
Milestone releases make it easier for developers to try out new widgets
before they've been finalized so that we can get your feedback on them
earlier on in the development lifecycle. To read more on this see:

As part of a major overhaul of the jQuery UI API, we'd also like to
invite the community to provide feedback on the first set of proposed
changes to jQuery UI's API starting with the Accordion. Scott Gonzalez
has a complete break-down of these changes available here:

release of the jQuery Mobile project this month. This release included a

1 release. Read more about this new release below:

**CSS Hook Extensibility in jQuery 1.4.3+** cssHooks allow you to “hook”
in to how jQuery gets and sets css properties. This means that you have
the ability to create a cssHook to help normalize differences between
browsers, or to add some missing functionality from the stock
jQuery.fn.css(). David Petersen’s fantastic article on cssHooks caught
our attention and we think it could come in useful in your projects.
