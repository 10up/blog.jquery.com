[Rich Manalang](http://manalang.com/), one of the regulars on the
[jQuery mailing list](http://jquery.com/discuss/), took the initiative
and with a little help has gotten the [jQuery
API](http://jquery.com/api/) posted up on
[gotAPI.com](http://gotapi.com/). If you haven't been over to gotAPI,
its a great online documentation resource that provides a comprehensive
API listing for most popular programming languages and frameworks. Great
job Rich! [![jQuery on gotAPI.com
