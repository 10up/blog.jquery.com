This is the first (of hopefully many) screencasts that will provide a
quick tutorial to a simple demo of jQuery in action. I plan on doing at
least 2-3 more based upon the talks that I've given lately - hopefully I
can trickle those out over the next week(s) or so. (Oh, and sorry if I
sound tired - that's because I am.) Enjoy!

3.85MB) video](http://jquery.com/files/videos/jquery-dl-demo.mov). (I
suspect that this version is much clearer - but not everyone supports
Quicktime files)
