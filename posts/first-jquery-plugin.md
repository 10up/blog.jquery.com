[Michael Geary](http://mg.to/) contacted me today to let me know that
he's finished the first third-party jQuery plugin. [His particular
plugin](http://mg.to/2006/01/25/json-for-jquery) loads in a remote JSON
file, which can then be manipulated further. The chaining of this
particular request doesn't serve many benefits, but this is still
something that I'm exploring further (maybe jQuery can support
JSON-traversing, along with DOM?). His code reminds me of a
templating/JSON plugin that [Jordan](http://csh.rit.edu/~psionic/) and I
started developing at [BarCampNYC](http://barcamp.org/), which allows
you to import external templating code. I'll have more details on this
plugin soon (and more details on an AJAX plugin that I'm developing, per
the requests of a lot of people). I'm planning on opening up a plugin
repository soon, so that plugin authors can submit their code, have an
area for documentation and comments, and allow for patches. More details
on this, soon.
