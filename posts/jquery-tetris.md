Following in the footsteps of the excellent [Yahoo! UI
Tetris](http://www.dustindiaz.com/basement/tetris.html) by [Dustin
Diaz](http://www.dustindiaz.com/) comes **[jQuery
Tetris](http://fmarcia.info/jquery/tetris/tetris.html)**. This
Javascript implementation of Tetris, written by Franck Marcia, comes in
at only about 5.8kb, compared to Dustin's 30kb for YUI Tetris. This is a
great example of the short code that's possible using jQuery, while
still making something that's quite cool.
