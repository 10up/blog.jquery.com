For those of you who have been following the jQuery blog the past couple
months, you may have noticed [John Resig's mention of a
secret](http://blog.jquery.com/2007/01/14/jquery-birthday-11-new-site-new-docs/):
"There's a jQuery book in the works!" Well, I am thrilled to be able to
leak a little more information about that secret. For the past few
months my friend Jonathan Chaffer and I have been hard at work on the
book, and everything is progressing well. Our writing is being supported
by a stellar group of technical reviewers, some of whom are members of
the jQuery development team. We'll be able to divulge details about the
book's contents soon. The publisher is readying a web page for it, so as
soon as that is completed, we can give you the full scoop.

About the Authors
-----------------

Jonathan Chaffer is a long-time Drupal contributor and creator of
Drupal's CCK. He also likes to make up bizarre band names and album
titles, based on snippets of conversations he overhears, at [Tweak the
Viking](http://www.tweaktheviking.com/). Karl Swedberg (that's me) is a
[jQuery
zealot](http://blog.jquery.com/2006/12/18/meet-the-people-behind-jquery/)
who runs the [Learning jQuery](http://www.learningjquery.com/) blog and
still tries to keep a bit of his former career as an English teacher
alive at his other blog, [English Rules](http://www.englishrules.com/).
Jonathan and Karl work together at [Structure
Interactive](http://www.structureinteractive.com/) in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, where they have been given a lot of freedom to use jQuery, as
well as standards-based, semantic HTML & CSS, in many of their projects.
