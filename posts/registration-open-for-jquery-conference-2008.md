Registration for jQuery Conference 2008 is officially open. [Register
now](http://events.jquery.com/) to ensure your spot! As
[announced](http://blog.jquery.com/2008/06/26/jquery-camp-2008-announced/),
this one-day conference will be held in **Boston** on **Sunday,
September 28**, and will feature two tracks of presentations (beginner
and advanced) from jQuery project members and a few special guest
speakers. A registration fee of **\$50** will help cover the cost of the
venue, as well as food, beverages, and T-shirts for all attendees. We're
finalizing a convenient venue, especially for those who will be
attending [The Ajax
Experience](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/) conference the
following Monday through Wednesday. We're still firming up the agenda as
well, but you can expect this to be a blow-out event. If you have any
questions, please feel free to contact us at *events [at]
