[![jQuery Plugin
Repository](http://blog.jquery.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/Plugin%20Repository.png)](http://jquery.com/plugins/)
One of the great aspects of jQuery is its extensibility, as evidenced by
the many excellent plugins that have been developed for it. The jQuery
team, and the [Web
team](http://docs.jquery.com/About/Contributors#Web_Team) in particular,
have been working hard behind the scenes to put together a [repository
to showcase these plugins](http://jquery.com/plugins/ "jQuery Plugins").
The new repository comes with a few features that are sure to help users
to find what they're looking for and determine which plugins will best
suit their needs. There's the (jQuery-based) ratings widget to let you
know how highly others value each plugin. The ratings are viewable by
all, and you can rate them yourself by simply registering on the site
with a user name and email address. You'll also have easier access to
change logs, demos, and documentation, as well as bug reporting and
feature requests. There are still a few rough edges to be smoothed out,
and the list of plugins on the site is admittedly small so far. **We're
requesting that plugin authors post their work to the new plugin
repository in the next couple weeks**, as we'll be gradually phasing out
the [plugins wiki page](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins). Special thanks
to Mike Hostetler for the hours of work he put in to get the repository
off to a great start. Check it out at:
