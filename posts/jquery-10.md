I'd like to take this opportunity to announce the brand new jQuery 1.0!
A lot of work has gone into this release. A lot of bugs fixed, a ton of
new features, and a complete overhaul of how the jQuery development
process is run. In reality, this release is so large, it's going to take
a couple days to release it (this includes a new version of the jQuery
web site). So bare with us as we make the transition over to full
release. There's some kinks that'll have to be worked out (namely,
finalizing the new documentation) but it's all in the pipeline and will
be ready within the next couple days. For now, here are some relevant
links to get you started:

-   [jQuery 1.0](http://jquery.com/src/jquery-1.0.js)
-   [jQuery 1.0 - Compressed](http://jquery.com/src/jquery-1.0.pack.js)
-   [API Documentation](http://jquery.com/api/)
-   [(Partial) Test Suite](http://jquery.com/test/)

If you want to build your own copies of jQuery, you can check it out of
Subversion and build it from the command line. You can get the latest
jQuery by doing:

    svn co svn://jquery.com/home/jquery/src/jquery

There's so much more to come. I'll be doing a post every day this week
detailing some aspect of jQuery 1.0 along with some screencasts
demonstrating what you can do with all the new code. Please, if you spot
any bugs, file them in the bug tracker:

-   [Bug Tracker](http://proj.jquery.com/dev/bugs/)
-   [Submit New Bug](http://proj.jquery.com/dev/bugs/new/)

I'd like to thank everyone who made this release possible. It's been a
lot of work, but the journey is only just beginning. I can't wait to
delve into some of the very exciting advances that we have planned.
Happy Coding! **Update:** Here's a fun fact. jQuery 1.0 has been
released nearly one year after it was [first
conceived](http://ejohn.org/blog/selectors-in-javascript/) as a post in
my weblog. Funny how those things work. **Update:** The very cool
[Visual jQuery](http://screencasts.visualjquery.com/visual/docs.xml)
site has also released a preview version of the new documentation in its
sharp style. The final release of their updated docs will be coming in
the next couple days.
