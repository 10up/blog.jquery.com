Hi there, you may not know me, but my name is Nate, and I am a
designer/programmer. Â I've been helping a bit with looking for bugs,
and with site design stuff, and though I'm not on the team list, I
started helping a bit after the list was written. Â Anyways, to help get
the word about jQuery out there in the world, I've gone ahead and
created some minimalistic wallpapers to adorn your desktop. Â You can
