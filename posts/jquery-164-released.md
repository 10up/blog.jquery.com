jQuery 1.6.4 Released
---------------------

This is a minor point release of jQuery. We're releasing it fix a couple
issues that came up during the release of jQuery 1.6.3.

You can get the code from the jQuery CDN:

-   [http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.js)

You can help us by dropping that code into your existing application and
letting us know that if anything no longer works. Please [file a
bug](http://bugs.jquery.com/) and be sure to mention that you're testing
against jQuery 1.6.4.

We want to encourage everyone from the community to try and [get
involved](http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved) in contributing back
to jQuery core. We've set up a [full
page](http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved) of information dedicated
towards becoming more involved with the team. The team is here and ready
to help you help us!
