In response to the flood of requests and emails, and our original
promise to work on this, we've got an announcement: we've added a single
day Beginner/Intermediate training right before the San Francisco jQuery
Conference :) [Tickets are on sale
now](http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/) (left side, below the fold). The
training will be provided by our friends at
[Bocoup](http://www.bocoup.com), and hosted by the ever-generous folks
at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com). Here's a snippet of what
Trainers Ben Alman and Rebecca Murphey will be covering:

> At Bocoup’s intermediate one-day jQuery training, you’ll work with
> jQuery veterans to build a foundation that will make you a stronger
> developer and get you prepared for all the great talks that you’ll see
> over the next two days. You’ll even learn the basics of creating your
> own jQuery plugin. Topics that will be covered include:
>
> -   The jQuery() function
> -   Selecting & Traversing
> -   Manipulating the DOM
> -   Making stuff happen with Events
> -   AJAX
> -   Enhancing with Effects
> -   Extending jQuery with Plugins
> -   jQuery UI
> -   jQuery Mobile

To note: the training and conference are both in San Francisco, but take
place in *different* locations. The training is in the heart of San Fran
on Market Street, and the conference is about five to ten minutes from
there, on the UCSF Mission Bay campus. Please also note that the
conference and training require *separate* admission tickets, so make
sure you've purchased both if you'd like to attend both. We're still
working on the possibility of adding an Advanced training, but thus far
have had mostly requests for beginner materials. So here that is :) Hope
you've all bought your tickets to the conference; can't wait to see you
there!
