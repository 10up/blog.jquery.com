[Cody Lindley](http://codylindley.com/) contacted me today to let me
know about [his views on
jQuery](http://codylindley.com/Javascript/241/jquery-to-the-rescue) -
and a [new jQuery demo
page](http://codylindley.com/blogstuff/js/jquery/). If you're looking
for more examples of what jQuery code looks like, and some of the neat
effects that it can do, you should definitely check it out. I've added a
link to his page onto the [jQuery Demo](http://jquery.com/docs/Demos/)
page.
