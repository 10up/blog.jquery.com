[Yuri Vishnevsky](http://yurivish.com/cloudspires/) has just released a
new [AJAX chat application](http://yurivish.com/yshout/) that makes
great use of jQuery. This application allows you to embed a chat area
into a section of your web site and have it update in real-time as users
chat with each other. It's really slick and works quite nicely. YShout
includes a bunch of nice features: - Unicode Support - An administration
area - Flood control - and a history viewer You can view
[demo](http://travis.annoyingdrew.com/ys/v3/yshout/) of it in action on
the [project page](http://yurivish.com/yshout/). ![YShout Admin

Probably the most interesting part, from the perspective as a jQuery
user, is that this isn't the first version of his application - it's the
third - and is the result of a complete re-write from Prototype to
jQuery. Yuri stated that the reason for this switch was that "the file
size coupled with the method chaining" together with the "intuitive
syntax". If you like this application, you should [Digg Yuri's
article](http://digg.com/design/YShout_A_PHP_AJAX_Shoutbox_has_gone_v3),
as I'm sure a lot of other webmasters would love to put this on their
web sites.
