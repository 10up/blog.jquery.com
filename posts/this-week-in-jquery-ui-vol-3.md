Welcome back to This Week in jQuery UI.

### Releases

#### jQuery UI 1.6rc2.6

Things were looking good for getting 1.6 final out this week, but we've
still got one issue with the Resizable plugin. Big thanks to Scott
González and Nick Levett for working on this. We're about half-way
there. In the meantime, you can beat up
[1.6rc2.6](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/03/jquery-ui-16rc26/). This
includes the resizable fixes Scott was able to merge. It improves
things, but we still want to fix it the rest of the way. Here's the lone
ticket: [\#4334 - Real World Image Cropper demo is
broken](http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4334).

### How about a sprint?

We did a jQuery UI sprint [a year ago last
week](http://docs.jquery.com/JQuerySprint), and it rocked. So we're
thinking of doing another.  Would you be interested? If so, how would
you like to contribute? Tests, code fixes, documentation, demos,
tutorials, answering questions, anything? Let us know. That’s it for
this week. Stay tuned for tonight’s installment of 'This Week in jQuery'
over on the [jQuery blog](http://blog.jquery.com/).
